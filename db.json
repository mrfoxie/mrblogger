Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of “intelligent agents” any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Automation</strong>, <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>Supercomputer</strong>, <strong>Quantum computers</strong> are currently leading technology in the world right now as you know many top leading companies in the industry are using <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>Automation</strong>, and many leading technology which help them to make there service’s better and easier to control. In <strong>video games</strong>, <strong>AI</strong> is used to generate <strong>responsive</strong>, <strong>adaptive</strong> or <strong>intelligent behaviors</strong> primarily in <strong>non-player characters (NPCs)</strong> similar to <strong>human-like intelligence</strong>. <strong>AI</strong> has been an integral part of video games since there inception in <strong>1950s</strong>.[^1]</p>\n<p><strong>Google</strong> also recently revealed it is using <strong>AI</strong> and <strong>machine learning techniques</strong> to more quickly <strong>detect breaking news</strong> around <strong>natural disasters</strong> and other <strong>crises</strong>. In a <strong>related development</strong>, <strong>Google</strong> said it has launched an update using language models to improve matching between news stories and available fact-checking.[^2]</p>\n<p>The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> for <strong>Android</strong> devices will be able to affect the user’s everyday life. For example, right now an <strong>AI</strong> app for <strong>Android</strong> can calculate the distance you walked on any given day as well as how many steps you have taken, how many flights of stairs you climbed and many other physical activity data.[^3]</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-truth-behind-Facebook-AI-inventing-a-new-language\"><a href=\"#The-truth-behind-Facebook-AI-inventing-a-new-language\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The truth behind Facebook AI inventing a new language\"></a>The truth behind Facebook AI inventing a new language</h3><p>In back 2017 one of the most talking question about <code>Why did Facebook shut down its own AI after its Bot invented its own language?</code> most of online articles mislead the topic at that time, but the original question was <code>Was Facebook right to shut down it&#39;s AI after it invented its own language?</code>[^4]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bob: i can i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>Alice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to</p>\n<p>Bob: you i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>Alice: balls have a ball to me to me to me to me to me to me to me</p>\n<p>Bob: i i can i i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>Alice: balls have a ball to me to me to me to me to me to me to me</p>\n<p>Bob: i . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>Alice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to</p>\n<p>Bob: you i i i i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>Alice: balls have 0 to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to</p>\n<p>Bob: you i i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>Alice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As above you can see the chat between <code>Bob</code> and <code>Alice</code> I’m not a cyber expert or some kind of decipher expert I leave it up-to you 😅.

Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to be used in interrogation in order to weaken the individual and force confessions through mind control. The project was organized through the `Office of Scientific Intelligence` of the CIA and coordinated with the `United State Army Biological Warfare Laboratories`. Other code name for the drug related experiments were `Project Bluebird` and `Project Artichoke`.\n\n\n\nThe operation was officially sanctioned in 1953, reduced in scope in 1964 and further curtailed in 1967. it was officially halted in 1973. The program also engaged in illegal activities, including the used of US and Canadian citizens as its unwitting test subjects, which led to controversy regarding it legitimacy. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects' mental states and brain functions. Techniques included the covert administration of high doses of [psychoactive drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug) (especially [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD)) and other chemicals, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory, deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of torture.\n\n\n\nThe scope of Project MKUltra was broad, with research undertaken at more then 80 institutions, including colleges and universities hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated using front organizations, although sometimes top of officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement.\n\n\n\nProject MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the `Church Committee` of the `United States Congress` and `Gerald Ford's United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States` (also known as the Rockefeller Commission).\n\n\n\nInvestigative effects were hampered by CIA Director `Richard Helms` order that all MKUltra files by `destroyed in 1973` the Church Committee and `Rockefeller Commission` investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the rtelatively small number of documents that survived Helms's destruction order. In 1997, a `Freedom of Information Act` requested uncovered a cache of `20,000 documents` related to project MKUltra which led to senate hearings later that year. Some surviving information regarding MKUltra was declassified in `July 2001`. In `December 2018`, declassified documents included a letter to an unidentified doctor discussing work on six dogs made to run, turn and stop via remote control and brain implants. Thanks to [TheBlackVault](https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/cia-mkultra-collection/) has the owner had `FOIA request` for all the documents pertaining to MKULTRA and related projects back in the late 1990s.

The CIA operated using front organizations, although sometimes top of officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA’s involvement.</p>\n<p>Project MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the <code>Church Committee</code> of the <code>United States Congress</code> and <code>Gerald Ford&#39;s United States President&#39;s Commission on CIA activities within the United States</code> (also known as the Rockefeller Commission).</p>\n<p>Investigative effects were hampered by CIA Director <code>Richard Helms</code> order that all MKUltra files by <code>destroyed in 1973</code> the Church Committee and <code>Rockefeller Commission</code> investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the rtelatively small number of documents that survived Helms’s destruction order. In 1997, a <code>Freedom of Information Act</code> requested uncovered a cache of <code>20,000 documents</code> related to project MKUltra which led to senate hearings later that year. Some surviving information regarding MKUltra was declassified in <code>July 2001</code>. In <code>December 2018</code>, declassified documents included a letter to an unidentified doctor discussing work on six dogs made to run, turn and stop via remote control and brain implants. Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/cia-mkultra-collection/\">TheBlackVault</a> has the owner had <code>FOIA request</code> for all the documents pertaining to MKULTRA and related projects back in the late 1990s.

There are multiple option in the movie where you will be confused and also some option will take you backward in the movie for different ending.

The object was spinning and emitted red, green, blue and orange light at a rate where all of the lights could be seen simultaneously. When a second jet was scrambled, the UFO moved away, maintaining a 25 mile buffer between itself and the jet. It then fired a detachment that chased the jet for a few miles. During this time, the jet attempted to fire back a missile, but lost its controls and communications before the detachment returned to the original UFO. The object then shot off another detachment that hit the ground on a dry lake bed, emitting a massive white light, but with no explosion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Space-Mysteries\"><a href=\"#Space-Mysteries\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Space Mysteries\"></a>Space Mysteries</h3><p>As I was going through internet I found a video where its refueling itself from sun well I’m thinking that whether it is fake or real at first glance its seams to be real but it may be fake also.

It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in the material and reality or the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.\n\nIt is been told that time has never stopped or will never be stopped its a continuous flow. If we try to make changes in past or future it will affect the path one mistake and everything is messed up.\n\n### Time Travel\n![Time](/images/posts/time.jpg)\n\nTime travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically with the use of a hypothetical device known as a time machine.\n\n### Can we go back in time?\n![Predestination](/images/posts/predestination.jpg)\n\nAlthough humans can't hop into a time machine and go back in time, we do know that clocks on aeroplanes and satellites travel at a different speed than those on earth.\n\n#### When did we knew that time travel is possible?\n\nMore than 100 years ago, a famous scientist named Albert Einstein came up with an idea about how time works. He called it relativity. This theory says that time and space are linked together. Einstein also said our universe has a speed limit: nothing can travel faster than the speed of light (186,000 miles per second).\n\n## Who was Sid Hurwich?\n![Sid Hurwich](/images/posts/sidhurwich.jpg)\n\nBorn in 1918, Sid Hurwich was a Jewish appliance repairman living in Toronto Canada who used to experiment with various kinds of technology. As a child, Sid showed great interest in collecting random junk and assembling the pieces into working machines. Later as an adult, he became famous as the man who could fix anything that was broken.\n\nIn 1934, Sid earned the distinction of being the first private appliance repairman in all of Canada. He was such a skilled technician that the local power company succeeded in taking him out of the army so he could develop the infrastructure of the public electrical utility.\n\nSid Hurwich earned enough money to set up two successful companies of his own. He was still young when he got a heart attack, only 36 and he retired.\n\n### EXTRAORDINARY TIME MACHINE THAT COULD ‘FREEZE TIME’\nHowever, he continued to experiment with technology and finally invented that extraordinary ‘freeze time’ machine that could also change the flow of time, and send out beams of influence to manipulate objects in distant locations.\n\nLocal authorities had problems to catch thieves in the wave of bank robberies that swept Toronto in 1969. So Hurwich contacted them and said that is possible to freeze time to find out what happened.\n\nThis account was given in the article in the Vancouver Sun-Times:\n>‘All I recall,’ said Bolton (one of the police officers in charge), ‘is that it was under the table – the device, whatever it was – and there was a bedspread over the table. He froze my service revolver. You couldn’t pull the trigger, you couldn’t lift it off the table and even on the table you couldn’t pull the trigger.’\n\nand then Sid said:\n>“…. Now take a look at your watches.” I remember one of them said, “When did this happen?” and I said, “The minute you walked through that door. You walked in there about 25 minutes ago. Now, look at your watches. You’re late about 25 minutes.”’ As the security officers filed out of his home, Sid’s wife overheard one of them suggest that the army should be told about the device. ‘That was the first time it entered my mind for war or army purposes or anything like that.’\n\nThe time machine later was used by military and it ended up in Israel, accorded in publication Foreign Report in 1977. \n\n>“The device sends out electronic rays to alter the natural composition of electronic fields and centres of gravity of weapons, instrument dials and mechanical devices … (using) the Hurwich principle there was no reason why the new beams could not reach and disable tanks, ground-to-ground missiles and complete radar systems. The beams could also be tacked together to form a screen that would make whole zones safe from bombs and missiles,”\n\nBut does they still have that device and do they still use it?\n\n\n### What happened to Sid Hurwich and his time-altering machine?\n\nWhether the time machine is still in possession of the Israeli military or not has been widely debated. Does the Israeli military still have the Hurwich device, and are they still using it on ‘special occasions’ or in dire situations of military crisis?\n\nIn ‘True Time Travel’ book by Richard Bullivant is written:\n>“Skeptics say that if they had a device that could provide a kind of shield from bombs and missiles, freeze weapons, and even slow or halt time, the Israeli military would be invincible and would not have suffered as many casualties as it has in its decades' long struggles with its antagonists in the Mideast. Others counter, however, by saying that the Hurwich device may be a two-edged sword. If it can ‘freeze’ the weapons of the enemy, it would also freeze the weapons of those employing the device. Thus, the device can perhaps only be used in a limited way – enough to knock out radar detection and other enemy electronics, for example – but not to induce the full-blown time-freeze effect for the benefit of the user.” \n\nNot only Richard wrote about it, but and many people over the years. Also, he said to police that it is not a new invention, and it is designed on principles that are already well known.\n\nBy now, researchers still can’t find out any information about him or his obituary. But, surely, he has passed on.\n\n\n## Truth or Fake\nProof of time travel: Physicists says that theoretical time travel is possible on both sides means in the future and the past. Time travel to the future seems practically possible.\n\n1. [Mike Tyson Match](/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-05#mike-tyson-match)\n2.

It was not an extraordinary match.\n\n But, when the footage of the match was watched closely next something unbelievable thing saw in the footage. In the footage, it was clear that someone was capturing the picture of Mike Tyson with a Smartphone.\n\n In fact, at that time, there was no existence of such types of smartphones.\n\n It is believed that he was that person who came from the future.\n\n### Charlie Chaplin Movie\n![Charlie Chaplin Movie](/images/posts/charlie-chaplin-moive.jpg)\n\n“The Circus” was the super hit movie of Charlie Chaplin which was released in 1928.\n\n Later, when someone was watching the movie closely, he saw unusual stuff in the movie.\n\n He saw there was a scene in the movie in which a lady was talking on a mobile phone like device.\n\n But at that time there was no existence of a mobile phone. The first mobile cell phone came into existence in 1973 which was of Motorola. Here is the video of it.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XbO2a3hFmO0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### London Bridge Opening\n ![London Bridge Opening](/images/posts/bridge-time-traveler.jpg)\n\n Out of all proofs of time travel, this assumes to be solid evidence of time travel.\n\n This photo was captured in 1941, during the re-opening ceremony of the South Fork Bridge in Gold Bridge, British Columbia.\n\n The style of wearing a man’s clothes in this photo is completely contrasting from other people.\n\n One gentleman is wearing a graphic t-shirt and black sunglass.\n\n Moreover, there is also a modern camera like device in his hand.\n\n But at that time all these things were not existed, which means these kinds of stuff were not invented.\n\n Later the forensic report was also carried out of this photo but this image was found clean and clear; there was no tampering with it.\n\n### A man from 2256\n![A man from 2256](/images/posts/man-from-2256.jpg)\n\nA 44-year-old man [Andrew Carlssin](https://www.quora.com/Was-Andrew-Carlssin-actually-from-the-future) was arrested on Jan 28, 2003, in Toronto, Canada, by FBI. He was detained on the suspicion of illegal inside information of the stock market.\n\n Because on the course of two weeks by investing just $800 he made out with over $350 million.\n\n How was it possible? He made out around 126 high-risk trades and never loses a single cent.\n\n And, during the four-hour confession, he stated he came from 2256.\n\n The FBI did not get any evidence of fraud from his side.\n\n On 3rd April 2003, an unidentified person came in the courtroom for a bail hearing and deposited $1 million for the bail of Andrew Carlssin. But after, they disappeared in the way and never have been met again.\n\n Later, the FBI could not find out where both of them came from and where they went.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/YgfJ21CUvKI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Swiss ring watch\n ![Swiss ring watch](/images/posts/Swiss-ring-watch.png)\n\n A watch was discovered when archaeologists began unsealing a tomb in China. That tomb was from the Ming Dynasty, and it was of 400-year-old.\n\n While unsealing they found a ring-like object inside the tomb. After investigation, it was found out that it was a small watch similar to be modern Swiss watch. This watch was 100 years old.\n Interestingly, when you see the watch from the front, you can read the time clearly on it.\n\n Moreover, archaeologists also found there was no tampering with the tomb.\n\n Consequently, if there was no tampering then how this watch went inside the 300-year-old tomb.\n\n Astonishingly, at that time even Switzerland didn’t become a country. Many people correlate this puzzling discovery to time travel.\n\n### 1500 years old mummy wearing Adidas sneaker shoe\n![1500 years old mummy wearing Adidas sneaker shoe](/images/posts/1500-years-old-mummy-wearing-adidas-sneaker-shoe.jpg)\n\nThe Mongolian Mummy was found in the Altai Mountains at the height of 10,000 feet from the ocean.\n\n This mummy was of the 1500 years old, and the stunning thing about this was that this mummy was wearing Adidas like sneakers in her feet. (this mummy was assumed to be of a woman)\n\n Adidas is a German company that started on August 18, 1949, by Adi Dassler and it is famous for its footwear.\n\n Some people are relating the story of this mummy with the event of time travel.\n\n This mummy was found in April 2016.\n\n### 17th century astronaut\n![17th-century astronaut](/images/posts/Resolved_Mystery_Of_Salamanca_Astronaut_From_The_Cathedral_Of_16th_Century.png)\nVery few are aware that the Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin was the first person to travel to outer space in 1961. But the mystery remains unveiled is why there a figure that exactly looks like an astronaut engraved in the stone of a 16th-century cathedral?\n\nBuilt between 1513 and 1733 there is a new cathedral of Salamanca, Spain when space travel was hardly thought of. This has made some people curious to speculate about the origin of the carving: is this the evidence of time travel? Or some other creatures from different planet engraved it? Or is some paranormal force at a play?\n\nThe Salamanca’s Astronaut is not a joke or a hoax, but a modern addition to the Cathedral; however, it has all the reserves of something which may provide confusion some 400 years from now. \n\n**New Cathedral Of Salamanca**\nThe building began at a time when the Gothic style was merging with the new Renaissance style. This cathedral retained more of its gothic counter because the administrators and the supervisors wanted the new cathedral to merge with the old one. Two elements were added that broke with the predominant style of the building: a Baroque and the bell tower.\n\nThe new cathedral of Salamanca was erected without the destruction of the old cathedral, but the walls of the newly erected lean on the North wall of the old one. This is the reason why the old cathedral had to be reinforced. The main entrance to the cathedral consists of three decorated arcs: each heading to the three naves of the church.\n\n**Who Did Carve The Astronaut Picture On The Cathedral?**\n\nThe truth behind this carving is, unfortunately, less interesting. When the church was rebuilt centuries ago it went a restoration program and the stonemasons decided to carve some modern figures. It is a tradition of the cathedral builders to add details or new carvings as a sort of some signature. In this case with the cathedral, quarryman Jeronimo Garcia given the action to add more images to the front of the building including an astronaut among some vines.\n\nThere also been a weird looking dragon eating ice cream (even the ice cream cones were not invented until the 20th century), a bull, a crayfish and a lynx.  But why the figures are chipped and broken even though it is not that much old? Vandalism in 2010\n\n![unidentified image](/images/posts/unidentified.jpg)\nThe vandalism has been recovered and now it has clear pictures today.\n\nIt is the only church that has some modern addition engraved on the building, Calahorra Cathedral in Spain (from the 16th century) has a cell phone that was added in 1996.\n![phone](/images/posts/phone.jpg)\n\n### The man from Taured\n![The man from Taured](/images/posts/the-Man-from-Taured.jpg)\n\nThe Man from Taured (sometimes referred to as the Taured Mystery of the Man Without a Country ) is a story about a man who arrives at a Japanese airport from a country called Taured. Many people have claimed this story to be true, so the crux of the problem pertains to Taured. One would notice that there is no country by the name of Taured, either today or during the purported time when the incident took place, i.e. the 1950s. The story ends with the man disappearing (forever) a day after arriving in Japan. Moreover, all of his documents, such as his passport and driver’s license also (conveniently) disappeared, thus making this strange story unsolvable.\n\n#### The Man’s ArrivalThe Man’s Arrival\nThe story of the ‘Man from Taured’ begins quite specifically in many sources with a hot day in July 1954. On that particular day, a man was said to have arrived at Haneda Airport, known also as Tokyo International Airport. This man has been described as Caucasian looking with a beard. Whilst his primary language is said to have been French, it has been purported that he spoke Japanese and many other languages as well.\n\n![Customs service](/images/posts/Customs-service.jpg)\nThe sequence of events then differs according to which version of the story one encounters. In one version, this man hands over his passport to be stamped, and the Japanese immigration officer notices something strange. Whilst the passport looked authentic, the country where it was issued, ‘Taured’, was recognized as non-existent, either by the officer or one of his / her colleagues, indicating that the man should be taken away for interrogation. In another version, the man mentioned that he was from Taured, and when the immigration officer did not believe him, he showed him/her his passport.\n\n#### Location of Taured\n\nThe next part of the story details the man trying to convince the immigration officers that Taured does indeed exist. According to the traveller, Taured was located between France and Spain and had by then been in existence for 1000 years.\n\nWhen shown a map, the man pointed to the area occupied by the Principality of Andorra and was puzzled as to why his country was called Andorra on the map. Both sides refused to give in – the Japanese officers insisted that Taured did not exist, and the traveller argued otherwise.\n\n![Location of Andorra](/images/posts/Location-of-Andorra.jpg)\n<sup>Location of Andorra (center of green circle) in Europe  (dark grey).</sup>\n\n#### Vanished!\nEventually, the man was held by the officers, as they were suspicious that he might be some kind of criminal. They brought him to a nearby hotel for the night, whilst they conducted their investigation. To ensure that the man did not escape during the night, two guards were placed outside his room. The next morning, when the officers went to the man’s room, they realized that he had simply vanished, as there were no signs of his escape. Additionally, all of his documents, which may serve as evidence for the story’s validity, had disappeared as well.\n\n\n#### Travel Through Time or Space? Or Just an Exaggeration?\nOne of the most notable explanations for this incident is that the man from Taured had somehow passed through a parallel dimension by accident, and ended up at Haneda Airport. It has been suggested that, based on this explanation, there is parallel earth which is similar to ours with the exception that the locations called Andorra here is known as Taured over there. Another suggestion is that the man was a time traveller from the future, thou this interpretation is arguably more problematic than the one supposing inter-dimensional travel.\n\nIt has also been suggested that an incident like that did indeed happen, though perhaps much less sensational. This more mundane story could have been embellished each time it was told, so much so that it eventually evolved into the great mystery that it is known as today.\n\nFinally, it is also entirely possible that this story is merely an urban legend. The story of the ‘Man from Taured’ might not have even occurred in the first place, and may have just been the creation of someone’s imagination.\n\n### John Titor\n![John Titor](/images/posts/john-titor.jpg)<sup> Is this true that this person who was seen on [London Bridge Opening](/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-05#london-bridge-opening).\n</sup>\n\nOne legendary hoax captivated fans of the supernatural and the paranormal like few others. November 2, 2000, saw the first online post by the individual who would come to be known as \"John Titor.\" Titor claimed to be a man from the future, sent to the past to retrieve... a portable computer. Though shrouded by forum avatars, his specific instructions on what he was here to accomplish, and what society would look like in his version of the future, kicked off a frenzy of investigation, speculation, and deception that has lasted for nearly two decades.\n\nSome people believed \"John Titor\" completely. Others became obsessed with errors and inconsistencies, digital detectives trying to uncover the truth behind the story. Before it was over, Titor would make his way to an animation studio in Japan, a wrestling ring in Pennsylvania, and a prison cell in Oregon.\n\nJohn Titor is a name used on several bulletin boards during 2000 and 2001 by a poster claiming to be an American military time traveller from 2036. Titor made numerous vague and specific predictions regarding calamitous events in 2004 and beyond, attracting world-wide attention during the ensuing decade. His descriptions of the aftermath of a nuclear war—including the devastation of numerous countries around the world, a breakup of the United States into five smaller sovereignties, and general destruction of the global environment and infrastructure—inspired fiction and music, and triggered investigations by journalists and others. Subsequent closer examination of Titor’s assertions provoked widespread scepticism. Inconsistencies in his explanations, the uniform inaccuracy of his predictions, and a private investigator’s findings all led to the general impression that the entire episode was an elaborate hoax. A 2009 investigation concluded that Titor was likely the creation of Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, along with his brother John, a computer scientist.\n\n#### Titor's Post\n\nThe first posts using John Titor’s military symbol appeared on the Time Travel Instituteforums on November 2, 2000, under the name TimeTravel_0. At that time the name “John Titor” was not being used. The posts discussed time travel in general, the first one being the “six parts” description of what a time machine would need to have to work (see below) and responses to questions about how such a machine would work. Early messages tended to be short. A second thread was also made due to shortcomings in the forum software at the time\n\nThe name “John Titor” was not introduced until January 2001, when TimeTravel_0 began posting at the Art Bell BBS Forums (which required a name or pseudonym for every account). The Titor posts ended in late March 2001.\n\nAround 2003, various websites reproduced Titor’s posts, re-arranging them into narratives. Not all refer to the original dates posted.\n\n![IBM-5100](/images/posts/john-titor-ibm-5100.jpg)\n\nIn his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from 2036, based in Tampa, Florida. He was assigned to a governmental time-travel project, and sent back to 1975 to retrieve an IBM 5100 computer which he said was needed to debug various legacy computer programs in 2036; a possible reference to the UNIX year 2038 problem. The IBM 5100 runs the APL and BASICprogramming languages.\n\nTitor had been selected for this mission specifically, given that his paternal grandfather was directly involved with the assembly and programming of the 5100. Titor claimed to be on a stopover in the year 2000 for “personal reasons,” to collect pictures lost in the (future) civil war and to visit his family, of whom he spoke often.\n\nTitor also said he had been, for a few months, trying to alert anyone that would listen about the threat of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease spread through beef products and about the possibility of civil war within the United States. When questioned about them by an online subscriber, Titor also expressed an interest in mysteries such as UFOs, which remained unexplained in his time. Titor suggested that UFOs and extraterrestrials might be travellers from much further into the future than his own time, with superior time machines.\n\n#### Time Machine\n\nTitor described his time machine on several occasions. In an early post, he described it as a “stationary mass, temporal displacement unit powered by two top-spin, dual positive singularities”, producing a “standard off-set Tipler sinusoid”.\n\nThe earliest post was more explicit, saying it contained the following:\n\n- Two magnetic housing units for the dual micro singularities\n- An electron injection manifold to alter mass and gravity of the micro singularities\n- A cooling and X-ray venting system\n- Gravity sensors, or a variable gravity lock\n- Four main caesium clocks\n- Three main computer units\n\nAccording to the posts, the device was installed in the rear of a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette convertible and later moved to a 1987 truck having four-wheel drive.\n\nTitor shared several scans of the manual of a “C204 Time Displacement Unit” with diagrams and schematics and posted some photographs of the device installed in the car.\n\nTitor claimed that the “Everett–Wheeler model of quantum physics,” better known as the many-worlds interpretation, was correct. The model posits that every possible outcome of a quantum decision occurs in a separate “universe.” Titor stated that this was the reason the grandfather paradox would not happen; following the logic of the argument, Titor would be killing a different John Titor’s grandfather in a timeline other than his own.\n\n>The grandfather paradox is impossible.\n>In fact, all paradox is impossible. The Everett–Wheeler–Graham or multiple world theory is correct.\n>All possible quantum states, events, possibilities, and outcomes are real, eventual, and occurring.\n>The chances of everything happening someplace at some time in the supervise are 100%.\n\n#### Predictions\nAlthough invoking the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, whereby events from his timeline may differ from our own, Titor also expressed assurance that the differences were minimal. As such, his descriptions have been interpreted as predictions and compared with historical events since 2001.\n\nThe most immediate of Titor’s predictions was of an upcoming civil war in the United States having to do with “order and rights”.He described it as beginning in 2004, with civil unrest surrounding the presidential election of that year. This civil conflict that he characterized as “having a Waco type event every month that steadily gets worse” would be “pretty much at everyone’s doorstep” and erupt by 2008.\n\nAs a result of the war, the United States would split into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives. This civil war, according to Titor, would end in 2015 with a brief but intense World War III.\n\nTitor refers to the exchange as “N Day”. Washington, D.C. and Jacksonville, Florida are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, Omaha, Nebraska would be the new U.S. capital. Titor was vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point, he characterized the hostilities as being led by “border clashes and overpopulation”. He also pointed to the contemporary conflict between Arabs and Israel as not a cause, but rather a milestone that precedes World War III.\n\nTitor claimed that as a 13-year-old in 2011, he joined the Fighting Diamondbacks, a shotgun infantry unit in Florida, for at least four years. In other posts, he described himself as hiding from the war.\n\n#### Criticism and discussion\nAs Titor gained significant attention, there also emerged analysis and discussion concerning the veracity of his claims about his origins and mission, and the future events he talked about. No John Titor or Titor family is known to exist, meaning that who posted as Titor used a pseudonym. The story has been called inconsistent as contradictions between statements at different times have been observed. Holding the many-worlds interpretation as correct, Titor claimed that his mission as a time traveller was to shape a timeline in which many chaotic events of his time, including World War III and the civil war in the US, never happened. In some supposed Titor’s appearances in the internet and other media segments before his main posts (notably in faxes to the radio talk show Coast to Coast AM in 1998), he stated that he was not able to change the future despite his efforts, suggesting one of the possible contradictions. Nevertheless, none of the specific events he predicted to a near future, chaotic or not, have come to happen (see below).\n\nSome issues with the technology have also been considered. In one of Titor’s pictures of a supposed time machine, a laser beam is seen allegedly being bent by gravitational distortion, but the view of nearby objects is not distorted as would be expected. Also, Titor knew about technical features of the IBM 5100 which were not available to the public at the time, albeit widely commented in the industry, suggesting he had some advanced understanding of the machine or computers in general.\n\n#### Predictive failures\nOne of Titor’s earliest assertions was that CERN would discover the basis for time travel sometime around 2001, with the creation of miniature black holes about half a year after his departure. This did not occur. An article published around the time he had predicted about miniature black holes created by CERN (a recurring theme, also ascribed to Fermilab and Brookhaven at various times)was taken by some to be evidence of this claim, but these events did not occur either.\n\nThe civil war did not break out after the 2004 US presidential election, nor did conflicts or military involvement in 2012. World War III did not happen in 2015.\n\nTitor unambiguously claimed that the last Olympics would occur in 2004. While it is unclear if he meant the summer or winter Olympics, both have occurred since this time.\n\nHowever, because Titor asserted that the many-worlds interpretation was proved correct by his time, his predictions could refer to another timeline and not ours, making them unfalsifiable. This led to different interpretations, including that he had effectively accomplished his mission by creating another timeline (despite his supposed previous statements that it would be too difficult), or that he inadvertently travelled to a different timeline (ours) and mistook it as his own, or that all-time travel is pointless if the chaotic timeline would not cease to exist.\n\n#### Story and consistency\nPotential contradictions have been observed in different Titor’s posts. In some of the posts, he claims that he was homeschooled, while in others he states that his basic education was conducted at the University of Florida. Similarly, he stated that he hid himself during the civil war in the U.S., while also stating in other instances that he fought in the war. In some posts, he claims that money is widely used and people still have credit cards, despite his statement that centralized banking no longer exists (this is either an inconsistency or implies the rise of private currencies).\n\nTitor’s story could also have been inspired by science fiction works. The use of an automobile as a time machine, for example, had been a key plot device in the popular 1985 movie Back to the Future and its sequels (as the DeLorean sports car), among others. Additionally, commentators have pointed out similarities between the Titor story and Pat Frank‘s classic post-apocalyptic science fiction novel Alas, Babylon. Among other similarities, Alas, Babylon takes place in a small river-side town in Florida just before and after a nuclear war and describes the struggle to survive as a family in the aftermath. In the book, the protagonist lives in the fictional town of “Fort Repose”, while Titor claimed to live in the “Fort”, formerly the University of Florida. The prediction of tiny black holes as a result of time travel (specifically, the sending back of information) is a key plot point from the 1980 novel Thrice Upon A Time by James P. Hogan.\n\nSome suggested that yet in the summer of 1998 before his posts, Titor sent two faxes to Art Bell’s radio program Coast to Coast AM, stating that “Y2K is a disaster. Many people freeze to death trying to get to warmer weather. The gov. tries to keep power by instituting martial law…” referring to popular legends of the time about the Y2K bug.\n\nIn the online story, Titor stated that a part of his mission was to prevent the coming world war by changing history. Yet some claimed that during an IRC chat in October 2000, a month before he began posting, Titor was asked if the future could be changed from his predictions, and answered: “It’s too late … I just wish things didn’t have to happen the way they will.”\n\n#### Technology\nTitor provided an image of a detail of a supposed time machine, with a laser pointer beam “being bent by the gravitational field produced outside the vehicle by the distortion unit”. The beam being “bent” reveals an inconsistency of objects near the beam not appearing to be bent as well: the framing of the window visible in the background, for instance, should appear distorted in proximity to a large gravity gradient, but it does not. Some have speculated the “beam” is an optical fibre.\n\nTitor claimed that he was sent back to obtain an IBM 5100 because it could translate several types of computer code. According to IBM engineer Bob Dubke, Titor’s statements regarding the IBM 5100’s little-known ability to emulate and debug mainframe systems were correct. Supporters state that this information was not publicly available in 2000 or 2001 when Titor made his declaration, and Titor himself stated that this feature was “discovered” as late as 2036 when Unix, as the underlying source behind all computer operating systems still running local infrastructures and other computational tasks, was only two years away from no longer functioning due to 32-bit integer limitations. However, this emulation capability was widely known in the industry and commented on in-depth in numerous publications dealing with both the 5100 and programmable microcode in general. References to this were also available on the Internet as early as 1999 and therefore predated Titor’s postings.\n\n#### Investigations\nAn Italian television program, Voyager – Ai confini della conoscenza, aired the results of an investigation of John Titor on May 19, 2008. Private investigator Mike Lynch found no registry evidence, past or present, of any individual named John Titor. He did, however, identify the John Titor Foundation, a for-profit company formed on September 16, 2003, with no office or address other than a rented post box in Kissimmee, Florida. An IP address connected with Titor also geolocated to Kissimmee.\n\nIn 2009, a report by John Hughston of the Hoax Hunter website named Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, as the CEO of the foundation. Lynch concluded that Haber and his brother Morey Haber, a computer scientist, were very likely the men behind John Titor, whom they introduced in 1998, accompanied by different predictions, including chaos due to the Y2K“bug”. John Hughston also reported that John Titor is a registered trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\n#### In popular culture\n- In 2003, the John Titor Foundation published a book, John Titor: A Time Traveler’s Tale (ISBN 1-59196-436-9), discussing his claims; the book is now out of print.\n- In 2004, Time Traveler Zero, a play based on the John Titor story, was staged in the United States.\n- The 2009 visual novel Steins; Gate, which was adapted into a critically acclaimed anime in 2011, is centred on John Titor and his theories. A civil war caused by SERN (the fictional version of CERN), due to their discovery of time travel, is covered as well.","source":"_posts/Are-We-Living-In-Simulation-Part-05.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Are We Living in Simulation Part 05\ndate: 2021-01-26 21:25:36\ndescription: \"What if you are given one chance either to go in the future or the past.

It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in the material and reality or the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.\n\nIt is been told that time has never stopped or will never be stopped its a continuous flow. If we try to make changes in past or future it will affect the path one mistake and everything is messed up.\n\n### Time Travel\n![Time](/images/posts/time.jpg)\n\nTime travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically with the use of a hypothetical device known as a time machine.\n\n### Can we go back in time?\n![Predestination](/images/posts/predestination.jpg)\n\nAlthough humans can't hop into a time machine and go back in time, we do know that clocks on aeroplanes and satellites travel at a different speed than those on earth.\n\n#### When did we knew that time travel is possible?\n\nMore than 100 years ago, a famous scientist named Albert Einstein came up with an idea about how time works. He called it relativity. This theory says that time and space are linked together. Einstein also said our universe has a speed limit: nothing can travel faster than the speed of light (186,000 miles per second).\n\n## Who was Sid Hurwich?\n![Sid Hurwich](/images/posts/sidhurwich.jpg)\n\nBorn in 1918, Sid Hurwich was a Jewish appliance repairman living in Toronto Canada who used to experiment with various kinds of technology. As a child, Sid showed great interest in collecting random junk and assembling the pieces into working machines. Later as an adult, he became famous as the man who could fix anything that was broken.\n\nIn 1934, Sid earned the distinction of being the first private appliance repairman in all of Canada. He was such a skilled technician that the local power company succeeded in taking him out of the army so he could develop the infrastructure of the public electrical utility.\n\nSid Hurwich earned enough money to set up two successful companies of his own. He was still young when he got a heart attack, only 36 and he retired.\n\n### EXTRAORDINARY TIME MACHINE THAT COULD ‘FREEZE TIME’\nHowever, he continued to experiment with technology and finally invented that extraordinary ‘freeze time’ machine that could also change the flow of time, and send out beams of influence to manipulate objects in distant locations.\n\nLocal authorities had problems to catch thieves in the wave of bank robberies that swept Toronto in 1969. So Hurwich contacted them and said that is possible to freeze time to find out what happened.\n\nThis account was given in the article in the Vancouver Sun-Times:\n>‘All I recall,’ said Bolton (one of the police officers in charge), ‘is that it was under the table – the device, whatever it was – and there was a bedspread over the table. He froze my service revolver. You couldn’t pull the trigger, you couldn’t lift it off the table and even on the table you couldn’t pull the trigger.’\n\nand then Sid said:\n>“…. Now take a look at your watches.” I remember one of them said, “When did this happen?” and I said, “The minute you walked through that door. You walked in there about 25 minutes ago. Now, look at your watches. You’re late about 25 minutes.”’ As the security officers filed out of his home, Sid’s wife overheard one of them suggest that the army should be told about the device. ‘That was the first time it entered my mind for war or army purposes or anything like that.’\n\nThe time machine later was used by military and it ended up in Israel, accorded in publication Foreign Report in 1977. \n\n>“The device sends out electronic rays to alter the natural composition of electronic fields and centres of gravity of weapons, instrument dials and mechanical devices … (using) the Hurwich principle there was no reason why the new beams could not reach and disable tanks, ground-to-ground missiles and complete radar systems. The beams could also be tacked together to form a screen that would make whole zones safe from bombs and missiles,”\n\nBut does they still have that device and do they still use it?\n\n\n### What happened to Sid Hurwich and his time-altering machine?\n\nWhether the time machine is still in possession of the Israeli military or not has been widely debated. Does the Israeli military still have the Hurwich device, and are they still using it on ‘special occasions’ or in dire situations of military crisis?\n\nIn ‘True Time Travel’ book by Richard Bullivant is written:\n>“Skeptics say that if they had a device that could provide a kind of shield from bombs and missiles, freeze weapons, and even slow or halt time, the Israeli military would be invincible and would not have suffered as many casualties as it has in its decades' long struggles with its antagonists in the Mideast. Others counter, however, by saying that the Hurwich device may be a two-edged sword. If it can ‘freeze’ the weapons of the enemy, it would also freeze the weapons of those employing the device. Thus, the device can perhaps only be used in a limited way – enough to knock out radar detection and other enemy electronics, for example – but not to induce the full-blown time-freeze effect for the benefit of the user.” \n\nNot only Richard wrote about it, but and many people over the years. Also, he said to police that it is not a new invention, and it is designed on principles that are already well known.\n\nBy now, researchers still can’t find out any information about him or his obituary. But, surely, he has passed on.\n\n\n## Truth or Fake\nProof of time travel: Physicists says that theoretical time travel is possible on both sides means in the future and the past. Time travel to the future seems practically possible.\n\n1. [Mike Tyson Match](/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-05#mike-tyson-match)\n2.

After investigation, it was found out that it was a small watch similar to be modern Swiss watch. This watch was 100 years old.\n Interestingly, when you see the watch from the front, you can read the time clearly on it.\n\n Moreover, archaeologists also found there was no tampering with the tomb.\n\n Consequently, if there was no tampering then how this watch went inside the 300-year-old tomb.\n\n Astonishingly, at that time even Switzerland didn’t become a country.

But the mystery remains unveiled is why there a figure that exactly looks like an astronaut engraved in the stone of a 16th-century cathedral?\n\nBuilt between 1513 and 1733 there is a new cathedral of Salamanca, Spain when space travel was hardly thought of. This has made some people curious to speculate about the origin of the carving: is this the evidence of time travel? Or some other creatures from different planet engraved it? Or is some paranormal force at a play?\n\nThe Salamanca’s Astronaut is not a joke or a hoax, but a modern addition to the Cathedral; however, it has all the reserves of something which may provide confusion some 400 years from now. \n\n**New Cathedral Of Salamanca**\nThe building began at a time when the Gothic style was merging with the new Renaissance style. This cathedral retained more of its gothic counter because the administrators and the supervisors wanted the new cathedral to merge with the old one. Two elements were added that broke with the predominant style of the building: a Baroque and the bell tower.\n\nThe new cathedral of Salamanca was erected without the destruction of the old cathedral, but the walls of the newly erected lean on the North wall of the old one. This is the reason why the old cathedral had to be reinforced. The main entrance to the cathedral consists of three decorated arcs: each heading to the three naves of the church.\n\n**Who Did Carve The Astronaut Picture On The Cathedral?**\n\nThe truth behind this carving is, unfortunately, less interesting. When the church was rebuilt centuries ago it went a restoration program and the stonemasons decided to carve some modern figures. It is a tradition of the cathedral builders to add details or new carvings as a sort of some signature. In this case with the cathedral, quarryman Jeronimo Garcia given the action to add more images to the front of the building including an astronaut among some vines.\n\nThere also been a weird looking dragon eating ice cream (even the ice cream cones were not invented until the 20th century), a bull, a crayfish and a lynx.  But why the figures are chipped and broken even though it is not that much old? Vandalism in 2010\n\n![unidentified image](/images/posts/unidentified.jpg)\nThe vandalism has been recovered and now it has clear pictures today.\n\nIt is the only church that has some modern addition engraved on the building, Calahorra Cathedral in Spain (from the 16th century) has a cell phone that was added in 1996.\n![phone](/images/posts/phone.jpg)\n\n### The man from Taured\n![The man from Taured](/images/posts/the-Man-from-Taured.jpg)\n\nThe Man from Taured (sometimes referred to as the Taured Mystery of the Man Without a Country ) is a story about a man who arrives at a Japanese airport from a country called Taured. Many people have claimed this story to be true, so the crux of the problem pertains to Taured. One would notice that there is no country by the name of Taured, either today or during the purported time when the incident took place, i.e. the 1950s. The story ends with the man disappearing (forever) a day after arriving in Japan. Moreover, all of his documents, such as his passport and driver’s license also (conveniently) disappeared, thus making this strange story unsolvable.\n\n#### The Man’s ArrivalThe Man’s Arrival\nThe story of the ‘Man from Taured’ begins quite specifically in many sources with a hot day in July 1954. On that particular day, a man was said to have arrived at Haneda Airport, known also as Tokyo International Airport. This man has been described as Caucasian looking with a beard. Whilst his primary language is said to have been French, it has been purported that he spoke Japanese and many other languages as well.\n\n![Customs service](/images/posts/Customs-service.jpg)\nThe sequence of events then differs according to which version of the story one encounters. In one version, this man hands over his passport to be stamped, and the Japanese immigration officer notices something strange. Whilst the passport looked authentic, the country where it was issued, ‘Taured’, was recognized as non-existent, either by the officer or one of his / her colleagues, indicating that the man should be taken away for interrogation. In another version, the man mentioned that he was from Taured, and when the immigration officer did not believe him, he showed him/her his passport.\n\n#### Location of Taured\n\nThe next part of the story details the man trying to convince the immigration officers that Taured does indeed exist. According to the traveller, Taured was located between France and Spain and had by then been in existence for 1000 years.\n\nWhen shown a map, the man pointed to the area occupied by the Principality of Andorra and was puzzled as to why his country was called Andorra on the map. Both sides refused to give in – the Japanese officers insisted that Taured did not exist, and the traveller argued otherwise.\n\n![Location of Andorra](/images/posts/Location-of-Andorra.jpg)\n<sup>Location of Andorra (center of green circle) in Europe  (dark grey).</sup>\n\n#### Vanished!\nEventually, the man was held by the officers, as they were suspicious that he might be some kind of criminal. They brought him to a nearby hotel for the night, whilst they conducted their investigation. To ensure that the man did not escape during the night, two guards were placed outside his room. The next morning, when the officers went to the man’s room, they realized that he had simply vanished, as there were no signs of his escape. Additionally, all of his documents, which may serve as evidence for the story’s validity, had disappeared as well.\n\n\n#### Travel Through Time or Space? Or Just an Exaggeration?\nOne of the most notable explanations for this incident is that the man from Taured had somehow passed through a parallel dimension by accident, and ended up at Haneda Airport. It has been suggested that, based on this explanation, there is parallel earth which is similar to ours with the exception that the locations called Andorra here is known as Taured over there. Another suggestion is that the man was a time traveller from the future, thou this interpretation is arguably more problematic than the one supposing inter-dimensional travel.\n\nIt has also been suggested that an incident like that did indeed happen, though perhaps much less sensational. This more mundane story could have been embellished each time it was told, so much so that it eventually evolved into the great mystery that it is known as today.\n\nFinally, it is also entirely possible that this story is merely an urban legend. The story of the ‘Man from Taured’ might not have even occurred in the first place, and may have just been the creation of someone’s imagination.\n\n### John Titor\n![John Titor](/images/posts/john-titor.jpg)<sup> Is this true that this person who was seen on [London Bridge Opening](/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-05#london-bridge-opening).\n</sup>\n\nOne legendary hoax captivated fans of the supernatural and the paranormal like few others. November 2, 2000, saw the first online post by the individual who would come to be known as \"John Titor.\" Titor claimed to be a man from the future, sent to the past to retrieve... a portable computer. Though shrouded by forum avatars, his specific instructions on what he was here to accomplish, and what society would look like in his version of the future, kicked off a frenzy of investigation, speculation, and deception that has lasted for nearly two decades.\n\nSome people believed \"John Titor\" completely. Others became obsessed with errors and inconsistencies, digital detectives trying to uncover the truth behind the story. Before it was over, Titor would make his way to an animation studio in Japan, a wrestling ring in Pennsylvania, and a prison cell in Oregon.\n\nJohn Titor is a name used on several bulletin boards during 2000 and 2001 by a poster claiming to be an American military time traveller from 2036. Titor made numerous vague and specific predictions regarding calamitous events in 2004 and beyond, attracting world-wide attention during the ensuing decade. His descriptions of the aftermath of a nuclear war—including the devastation of numerous countries around the world, a breakup of the United States into five smaller sovereignties, and general destruction of the global environment and infrastructure—inspired fiction and music, and triggered investigations by journalists and others. Subsequent closer examination of Titor’s assertions provoked widespread scepticism. Inconsistencies in his explanations, the uniform inaccuracy of his predictions, and a private investigator’s findings all led to the general impression that the entire episode was an elaborate hoax. A 2009 investigation concluded that Titor was likely the creation of Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, along with his brother John, a computer scientist.\n\n#### Titor's Post\n\nThe first posts using John Titor’s military symbol appeared on the Time Travel Instituteforums on November 2, 2000, under the name TimeTravel_0. At that time the name “John Titor” was not being used. The posts discussed time travel in general, the first one being the “six parts” description of what a time machine would need to have to work (see below) and responses to questions about how such a machine would work. Early messages tended to be short. A second thread was also made due to shortcomings in the forum software at the time\n\nThe name “John Titor” was not introduced until January 2001, when TimeTravel_0 began posting at the Art Bell BBS Forums (which required a name or pseudonym for every account). The Titor posts ended in late March 2001.\n\nAround 2003, various websites reproduced Titor’s posts, re-arranging them into narratives. Not all refer to the original dates posted.\n\n![IBM-5100](/images/posts/john-titor-ibm-5100.jpg)\n\nIn his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from 2036, based in Tampa, Florida. He was assigned to a governmental time-travel project, and sent back to 1975 to retrieve an IBM 5100 computer which he said was needed to debug various legacy computer programs in 2036; a possible reference to the UNIX year 2038 problem. The IBM 5100 runs the APL and BASICprogramming languages.\n\nTitor had been selected for this mission specifically, given that his paternal grandfather was directly involved with the assembly and programming of the 5100. Titor claimed to be on a stopover in the year 2000 for “personal reasons,” to collect pictures lost in the (future) civil war and to visit his family, of whom he spoke often.\n\nTitor also said he had been, for a few months, trying to alert anyone that would listen about the threat of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease spread through beef products and about the possibility of civil war within the United States. When questioned about them by an online subscriber, Titor also expressed an interest in mysteries such as UFOs, which remained unexplained in his time. Titor suggested that UFOs and extraterrestrials might be travellers from much further into the future than his own time, with superior time machines.\n\n#### Time Machine\n\nTitor described his time machine on several occasions. In an early post, he described it as a “stationary mass, temporal displacement unit powered by two top-spin, dual positive singularities”, producing a “standard off-set Tipler sinusoid”.\n\nThe earliest post was more explicit, saying it contained the following:\n\n- Two magnetic housing units for the dual micro singularities\n- An electron injection manifold to alter mass and gravity of the micro singularities\n- A cooling and X-ray venting system\n- Gravity sensors, or a variable gravity lock\n- Four main caesium clocks\n- Three main computer units\n\nAccording to the posts, the device was installed in the rear of a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette convertible and later moved to a 1987 truck having four-wheel drive.\n\nTitor shared several scans of the manual of a “C204 Time Displacement Unit” with diagrams and schematics and posted some photographs of the device installed in the car.\n\nTitor claimed that the “Everett–Wheeler model of quantum physics,” better known as the many-worlds interpretation, was correct. The model posits that every possible outcome of a quantum decision occurs in a separate “universe.” Titor stated that this was the reason the grandfather paradox would not happen; following the logic of the argument, Titor would be killing a different John Titor’s grandfather in a timeline other than his own.\n\n>The grandfather paradox is impossible.\n>In fact, all paradox is impossible. The Everett–Wheeler–Graham or multiple world theory is correct.\n>All possible quantum states, events, possibilities, and outcomes are real, eventual, and occurring.\n>The chances of everything happening someplace at some time in the supervise are 100%.\n\n#### Predictions\nAlthough invoking the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, whereby events from his timeline may differ from our own, Titor also expressed assurance that the differences were minimal. As such, his descriptions have been interpreted as predictions and compared with historical events since 2001.\n\nThe most immediate of Titor’s predictions was of an upcoming civil war in the United States having to do with “order and rights”.He described it as beginning in 2004, with civil unrest surrounding the presidential election of that year. This civil conflict that he characterized as “having a Waco type event every month that steadily gets worse” would be “pretty much at everyone’s doorstep” and erupt by 2008.\n\nAs a result of the war, the United States would split into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives. This civil war, according to Titor, would end in 2015 with a brief but intense World War III.\n\nTitor refers to the exchange as “N Day”. Washington, D.C. and Jacksonville, Florida are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, Omaha, Nebraska would be the new U.S. capital. Titor was vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point, he characterized the hostilities as being led by “border clashes and overpopulation”. He also pointed to the contemporary conflict between Arabs and Israel as not a cause, but rather a milestone that precedes World War III.\n\nTitor claimed that as a 13-year-old in 2011, he joined the Fighting Diamondbacks, a shotgun infantry unit in Florida, for at least four years. In other posts, he described himself as hiding from the war.\n\n#### Criticism and discussion\nAs Titor gained significant attention, there also emerged analysis and discussion concerning the veracity of his claims about his origins and mission, and the future events he talked about. No John Titor or Titor family is known to exist, meaning that who posted as Titor used a pseudonym. The story has been called inconsistent as contradictions between statements at different times have been observed. Holding the many-worlds interpretation as correct, Titor claimed that his mission as a time traveller was to shape a timeline in which many chaotic events of his time, including World War III and the civil war in the US, never happened. In some supposed Titor’s appearances in the internet and other media segments before his main posts (notably in faxes to the radio talk show Coast to Coast AM in 1998), he stated that he was not able to change the future despite his efforts, suggesting one of the possible contradictions. Nevertheless, none of the specific events he predicted to a near future, chaotic or not, have come to happen (see below).\n\nSome issues with the technology have also been considered. In one of Titor’s pictures of a supposed time machine, a laser beam is seen allegedly being bent by gravitational distortion, but the view of nearby objects is not distorted as would be expected. Also, Titor knew about technical features of the IBM 5100 which were not available to the public at the time, albeit widely commented in the industry, suggesting he had some advanced understanding of the machine or computers in general.\n\n#### Predictive failures\nOne of Titor’s earliest assertions was that CERN would discover the basis for time travel sometime around 2001, with the creation of miniature black holes about half a year after his departure. This did not occur. An article published around the time he had predicted about miniature black holes created by CERN (a recurring theme, also ascribed to Fermilab and Brookhaven at various times)was taken by some to be evidence of this claim, but these events did not occur either.\n\nThe civil war did not break out after the 2004 US presidential election, nor did conflicts or military involvement in 2012. World War III did not happen in 2015.\n\nTitor unambiguously claimed that the last Olympics would occur in 2004. While it is unclear if he meant the summer or winter Olympics, both have occurred since this time.\n\nHowever, because Titor asserted that the many-worlds interpretation was proved correct by his time, his predictions could refer to another timeline and not ours, making them unfalsifiable. This led to different interpretations, including that he had effectively accomplished his mission by creating another timeline (despite his supposed previous statements that it would be too difficult), or that he inadvertently travelled to a different timeline (ours) and mistook it as his own, or that all-time travel is pointless if the chaotic timeline would not cease to exist.\n\n#### Story and consistency\nPotential contradictions have been observed in different Titor’s posts. In some of the posts, he claims that he was homeschooled, while in others he states that his basic education was conducted at the University of Florida. Similarly, he stated that he hid himself during the civil war in the U.S., while also stating in other instances that he fought in the war. In some posts, he claims that money is widely used and people still have credit cards, despite his statement that centralized banking no longer exists (this is either an inconsistency or implies the rise of private currencies).\n\nTitor’s story could also have been inspired by science fiction works. The use of an automobile as a time machine, for example, had been a key plot device in the popular 1985 movie Back to the Future and its sequels (as the DeLorean sports car), among others. Additionally, commentators have pointed out similarities between the Titor story and Pat Frank‘s classic post-apocalyptic science fiction novel Alas, Babylon. Among other similarities, Alas, Babylon takes place in a small river-side town in Florida just before and after a nuclear war and describes the struggle to survive as a family in the aftermath. In the book, the protagonist lives in the fictional town of “Fort Repose”, while Titor claimed to live in the “Fort”, formerly the University of Florida. The prediction of tiny black holes as a result of time travel (specifically, the sending back of information) is a key plot point from the 1980 novel Thrice Upon A Time by James P. Hogan.\n\nSome suggested that yet in the summer of 1998 before his posts, Titor sent two faxes to Art Bell’s radio program Coast to Coast AM, stating that “Y2K is a disaster. Many people freeze to death trying to get to warmer weather. The gov. tries to keep power by instituting martial law…” referring to popular legends of the time about the Y2K bug.\n\nIn the online story, Titor stated that a part of his mission was to prevent the coming world war by changing history. Yet some claimed that during an IRC chat in October 2000, a month before he began posting, Titor was asked if the future could be changed from his predictions, and answered: “It’s too late … I just wish things didn’t have to happen the way they will.”\n\n#### Technology\nTitor provided an image of a detail of a supposed time machine, with a laser pointer beam “being bent by the gravitational field produced outside the vehicle by the distortion unit”. The beam being “bent” reveals an inconsistency of objects near the beam not appearing to be bent as well: the framing of the window visible in the background, for instance, should appear distorted in proximity to a large gravity gradient, but it does not. Some have speculated the “beam” is an optical fibre.\n\nTitor claimed that he was sent back to obtain an IBM 5100 because it could translate several types of computer code. According to IBM engineer Bob Dubke, Titor’s statements regarding the IBM 5100’s little-known ability to emulate and debug mainframe systems were correct. Supporters state that this information was not publicly available in 2000 or 2001 when Titor made his declaration, and Titor himself stated that this feature was “discovered” as late as 2036 when Unix, as the underlying source behind all computer operating systems still running local infrastructures and other computational tasks, was only two years away from no longer functioning due to 32-bit integer limitations. However, this emulation capability was widely known in the industry and commented on in-depth in numerous publications dealing with both the 5100 and programmable microcode in general. References to this were also available on the Internet as early as 1999 and therefore predated Titor’s postings.\n\n#### Investigations\nAn Italian television program, Voyager – Ai confini della conoscenza, aired the results of an investigation of John Titor on May 19, 2008. Private investigator Mike Lynch found no registry evidence, past or present, of any individual named John Titor. He did, however, identify the John Titor Foundation, a for-profit company formed on September 16, 2003, with no office or address other than a rented post box in Kissimmee, Florida. An IP address connected with Titor also geolocated to Kissimmee.\n\nIn 2009, a report by John Hughston of the Hoax Hunter website named Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, as the CEO of the foundation. Lynch concluded that Haber and his brother Morey Haber, a computer scientist, were very likely the men behind John Titor, whom they introduced in 1998, accompanied by different predictions, including chaos due to the Y2K“bug”. John Hughston also reported that John Titor is a registered trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\n#### In popular culture\n- In 2003, the John Titor Foundation published a book, John Titor: A Time Traveler’s Tale (ISBN 1-59196-436-9), discussing his claims; the book is now out of print.\n- In 2004, Time Traveler Zero, a play based on the John Titor story, was staged in the United States.\n- The 2009 visual novel Steins; Gate, which was adapted into a critically acclaimed anime in 2011, is centred on John Titor and his theories. A civil war caused by SERN (the fictional version of CERN), due to their discovery of time travel, is covered as well.","slug":"Are-We-Living-In-Simulation-Part-05","published":1,"updated":"2025-01-10T03:40:13.640Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cm5uu6j5h0008t3yr9mamcbve","content":"<p><img src=\"/images/posts/time-travel.jpg\" alt=\"Time Travel\"></p>\n<p>As in <a href=\"/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-01/\">part 1</a>, we have talked about <strong>Quantum Computers</strong>, <strong>Facebook AI Chat</strong>, and <strong>Predictions of AI Robots</strong> wherein <a href=\"/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-02/\">part 2</a> we had a recap of <strong>part 1</strong> and also <strong>The Matrix</strong> movie, <strong>Roswell UFO Incident</strong>, wherein <a href=\"/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-03/\">part 3</a> we discussed on <a href=\"/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-03#MKUltra\"><strong>MKUltra</strong></a> performed by <code>US Central Intelligence Agency</code>, <a href=\"/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-03#Black-Mirror-Bandersnatch\"><code>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</code></a> movie where you can control <strong>Stefan Butler</strong> by given two choices which leads to a different path in the movies.

This cathedral retained more of its gothic counter because the administrators and the supervisors wanted the new cathedral to merge with the old one. Two elements were added that broke with the predominant style of the building: a Baroque and the bell tower.</p>\n<p>The new cathedral of Salamanca was erected without the destruction of the old cathedral, but the walls of the newly erected lean on the North wall of the old one. This is the reason why the old cathedral had to be reinforced. The main entrance to the cathedral consists of three decorated arcs: each heading to the three naves of the church.</p>\n<p><strong>Who Did Carve The Astronaut Picture On The Cathedral?</strong></p>\n<p>The truth behind this carving is, unfortunately, less interesting. When the church was rebuilt centuries ago it went a restoration program and the stonemasons decided to carve some modern figures. It is a tradition of the cathedral builders to add details or new carvings as a sort of some signature. In this case with the cathedral, quarryman Jeronimo Garcia given the action to add more images to the front of the building including an astronaut among some vines.</p>\n<p>There also been a weird looking dragon eating ice cream (even the ice cream cones were not invented until the 20th century), a bull, a crayfish and a lynx.

Many people have claimed this story to be true, so the crux of the problem pertains to Taured. One would notice that there is no country by the name of Taured, either today or during the purported time when the incident took place, i.e. the 1950s. The story ends with the man disappearing (forever) a day after arriving in Japan. Moreover, all of his documents, such as his passport and driver’s license also (conveniently) disappeared, thus making this strange story unsolvable.</p>\n<h4 id=\"The-Man’s-ArrivalThe-Man’s-Arrival\"><a href=\"#The-Man’s-ArrivalThe-Man’s-Arrival\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Man’s ArrivalThe Man’s Arrival\"></a>The Man’s ArrivalThe Man’s Arrival</h4><p>The story of the ‘Man from Taured’ begins quite specifically in many sources with a hot day in July 1954. On that particular day, a man was said to have arrived at Haneda Airport, known also as Tokyo International Airport. This man has been described as Caucasian looking with a beard. Whilst his primary language is said to have been French, it has been purported that he spoke Japanese and many other languages as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/Customs-service.jpg\" alt=\"Customs service\"><br>The sequence of events then differs according to which version of the story one encounters. In one version, this man hands over his passport to be stamped, and the Japanese immigration officer notices something strange. Whilst the passport looked authentic, the country where it was issued, ‘Taured’, was recognized as non-existent, either by the officer or one of his &#x2F; her colleagues, indicating that the man should be taken away for interrogation. In another version, the man mentioned that he was from Taured, and when the immigration officer did not believe him, he showed him&#x2F;her his passport.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Location-of-Taured\"><a href=\"#Location-of-Taured\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Location of Taured\"></a>Location of Taured</h4><p>The next part of the story details the man trying to convince the immigration officers that Taured does indeed exist. According to the traveller, Taured was located between France and Spain and had by then been in existence for 1000 years.</p>\n<p>When shown a map, the man pointed to the area occupied by the Principality of Andorra and was puzzled as to why his country was called Andorra on the map. Both sides refused to give in – the Japanese officers insisted that Taured did not exist, and the traveller argued otherwise.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/Location-of-Andorra.jpg\" alt=\"Location of Andorra\"><br><sup>Location of Andorra (center of green circle) in Europe  (dark grey).</sup></p>\n<h4 id=\"Vanished\"><a href=\"#Vanished\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Vanished!\"></a>Vanished!</h4><p>Eventually, the man was held by the officers, as they were suspicious that he might be some kind of criminal. They brought him to a nearby hotel for the night, whilst they conducted their investigation. To ensure that the man did not escape during the night, two guards were placed outside his room. The next morning, when the officers went to the man’s room, they realized that he had simply vanished, as there were no signs of his escape. Additionally, all of his documents, which may serve as evidence for the story’s validity, had disappeared as well.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Travel-Through-Time-or-Space-Or-Just-an-Exaggeration\"><a href=\"#Travel-Through-Time-or-Space-Or-Just-an-Exaggeration\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Travel Through Time or Space? Or Just an Exaggeration?\"></a>Travel Through Time or Space? Or Just an Exaggeration?</h4><p>One of the most notable explanations for this incident is that the man from Taured had somehow passed through a parallel dimension by accident, and ended up at Haneda Airport. It has been suggested that, based on this explanation, there is parallel earth which is similar to ours with the exception that the locations called Andorra here is known as Taured over there. Another suggestion is that the man was a time traveller from the future, thou this interpretation is arguably more problematic than the one supposing inter-dimensional travel.</p>\n<p>It has also been suggested that an incident like that did indeed happen, though perhaps much less sensational. This more mundane story could have been embellished each time it was told, so much so that it eventually evolved into the great mystery that it is known as today.</p>\n<p>Finally, it is also entirely possible that this story is merely an urban legend. The story of the ‘Man from Taured’ might not have even occurred in the first place, and may have just been the creation of someone’s imagination.</p>\n<h3 id=\"John-Titor\"><a href=\"#John-Titor\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"John Titor\"></a>John Titor</h3><p><img src=\"/images/posts/john-titor.jpg\" alt=\"John Titor\"><sup> Is this true that this person who was seen on <a href=\"/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-05#london-bridge-opening\">London Bridge Opening</a>.<br></sup></p>\n<p>One legendary hoax captivated fans of the supernatural and the paranormal like few others. November 2, 2000, saw the first online post by the individual who would come to be known as “John Titor.” Titor claimed to be a man from the future, sent to the past to retrieve… a portable computer. Though shrouded by forum avatars, his specific instructions on what he was here to accomplish, and what society would look like in his version of the future, kicked off a frenzy of investigation, speculation, and deception that has lasted for nearly two decades.</p>\n<p>Some people believed “John Titor” completely. Others became obsessed with errors and inconsistencies, digital detectives trying to uncover the truth behind the story. Before it was over, Titor would make his way to an animation studio in Japan, a wrestling ring in Pennsylvania, and a prison cell in Oregon.</p>\n<p>John Titor is a name used on several bulletin boards during 2000 and 2001 by a poster claiming to be an American military time traveller from 2036. Titor made numerous vague and specific predictions regarding calamitous events in 2004 and beyond, attracting world-wide attention during the ensuing decade. His descriptions of the aftermath of a nuclear war—including the devastation of numerous countries around the world, a breakup of the United States into five smaller sovereignties, and general destruction of the global environment and infrastructure—inspired fiction and music, and triggered investigations by journalists and others. Subsequent closer examination of Titor’s assertions provoked widespread scepticism. Inconsistencies in his explanations, the uniform inaccuracy of his predictions, and a private investigator’s findings all led to the general impression that the entire episode was an elaborate hoax. A 2009 investigation concluded that Titor was likely the creation of Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, along with his brother John, a computer scientist.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Titor’s-Post\"><a href=\"#Titor’s-Post\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Titor’s Post\"></a>Titor’s Post</h4><p>The first posts using John Titor’s military symbol appeared on the Time Travel Instituteforums on November 2, 2000, under the name TimeTravel_0. At that time the name “John Titor” was not being used. The posts discussed time travel in general, the first one being the “six parts” description of what a time machine would need to have to work (see below) and responses to questions about how such a machine would work. Early messages tended to be short. A second thread was also made due to shortcomings in the forum software at the time</p>\n<p>The name “John Titor” was not introduced until January 2001, when TimeTravel_0 began posting at the Art Bell BBS Forums (which required a name or pseudonym for every account). The Titor posts ended in late March 2001.</p>\n<p>Around 2003, various websites reproduced Titor’s posts, re-arranging them into narratives. Not all refer to the original dates posted.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/john-titor-ibm-5100.jpg\" alt=\"IBM-5100\"></p>\n<p>In his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from 2036, based in Tampa, Florida. He was assigned to a governmental time-travel project, and sent back to 1975 to retrieve an IBM 5100 computer which he said was needed to debug various legacy computer programs in 2036; a possible reference to the UNIX year 2038 problem. The IBM 5100 runs the APL and BASICprogramming languages.</p>\n<p>Titor had been selected for this mission specifically, given that his paternal grandfather was directly involved with the assembly and programming of the 5100. Titor claimed to be on a stopover in the year 2000 for “personal reasons,” to collect pictures lost in the (future) civil war and to visit his family, of whom he spoke often.</p>\n<p>Titor also said he had been, for a few months, trying to alert anyone that would listen about the threat of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease spread through beef products and about the possibility of civil war within the United States. When questioned about them by an online subscriber, Titor also expressed an interest in mysteries such as UFOs, which remained unexplained in his time. Titor suggested that UFOs and extraterrestrials might be travellers from much further into the future than his own time, with superior time machines.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Time-Machine\"><a href=\"#Time-Machine\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Time Machine\"></a>Time Machine</h4><p>Titor described his time machine on several occasions. In an early post, he described it as a “stationary mass, temporal displacement unit powered by two top-spin, dual positive singularities”, producing a “standard off-set Tipler sinusoid”.</p>\n<p>The earliest post was more explicit, saying it contained the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two magnetic housing units for the dual micro singularities</li>\n<li>An electron injection manifold to alter mass and gravity of the micro singularities</li>\n<li>A cooling and X-ray venting system</li>\n<li>Gravity sensors, or a variable gravity lock</li>\n<li>Four main caesium clocks</li>\n<li>Three main computer units</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the posts, the device was installed in the rear of a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette convertible and later moved to a 1987 truck having four-wheel drive.</p>\n<p>Titor shared several scans of the manual of a “C204 Time Displacement Unit” with diagrams and schematics and posted some photographs of the device installed in the car.</p>\n<p>Titor claimed that the “Everett–Wheeler model of quantum physics,” better known as the many-worlds interpretation, was correct. The model posits that every possible outcome of a quantum decision occurs in a separate “universe.” Titor stated that this was the reason the grandfather paradox would not happen; following the logic of the argument, Titor would be killing a different John Titor’s grandfather in a timeline other than his own.</p>\n<blockquote><span class=\"custom-blockquote-svg\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" data-reactroot=\"\">\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M22 12C22 6.5 17.5 2 12 2C6.5 2 2 6.5 2 12C2 17.5 6.5 22 12 22C13.8 22 15.5 21.5 17 20.6L22 22L20.7 17C21.5 15.5 22 13.8 22 12Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M17 8.5C15.23 8.97 14.07 10.84 14.01 13.27C14 13.33 14 13.4 14 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M9 8.5C7.23 8.97 6.07 10.84 6.01 13.27C6 13.33 6 13.4 6 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n</svg>\n</span><p>The grandfather paradox is impossible.<br>In fact, all paradox is impossible.

As such, his descriptions have been interpreted as predictions and compared with historical events since 2001.</p>\n<p>The most immediate of Titor’s predictions was of an upcoming civil war in the United States having to do with “order and rights”.He described it as beginning in 2004, with civil unrest surrounding the presidential election of that year. This civil conflict that he characterized as “having a Waco type event every month that steadily gets worse” would be “pretty much at everyone’s doorstep” and erupt by 2008.</p>\n<p>As a result of the war, the United States would split into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives. This civil war, according to Titor, would end in 2015 with a brief but intense World War III.</p>\n<p>Titor refers to the exchange as “N Day”. Washington, D.C. and Jacksonville, Florida are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, Omaha, Nebraska would be the new U.S. capital. Titor was vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point, he characterized the hostilities as being led by “border clashes and overpopulation”. He also pointed to the contemporary conflict between Arabs and Israel as not a cause, but rather a milestone that precedes World War III.</p>\n<p>Titor claimed that as a 13-year-old in 2011, he joined the Fighting Diamondbacks, a shotgun infantry unit in Florida, for at least four years. In other posts, he described himself as hiding from the war.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Criticism-and-discussion\"><a href=\"#Criticism-and-discussion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Criticism and discussion\"></a>Criticism and discussion</h4><p>As Titor gained significant attention, there also emerged analysis and discussion concerning the veracity of his claims about his origins and mission, and the future events he talked about. No John Titor or Titor family is known to exist, meaning that who posted as Titor used a pseudonym. The story has been called inconsistent as contradictions between statements at different times have been observed. Holding the many-worlds interpretation as correct, Titor claimed that his mission as a time traveller was to shape a timeline in which many chaotic events of his time, including World War III and the civil war in the US, never happened. In some supposed Titor’s appearances in the internet and other media segments before his main posts (notably in faxes to the radio talk show Coast to Coast AM in 1998), he stated that he was not able to change the future despite his efforts, suggesting one of the possible contradictions. Nevertheless, none of the specific events he predicted to a near future, chaotic or not, have come to happen (see below).</p>\n<p>Some issues with the technology have also been considered. In one of Titor’s pictures of a supposed time machine, a laser beam is seen allegedly being bent by gravitational distortion, but the view of nearby objects is not distorted as would be expected. Also, Titor knew about technical features of the IBM 5100 which were not available to the public at the time, albeit widely commented in the industry, suggesting he had some advanced understanding of the machine or computers in general.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Predictive-failures\"><a href=\"#Predictive-failures\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Predictive failures\"></a>Predictive failures</h4><p>One of Titor’s earliest assertions was that CERN would discover the basis for time travel sometime around 2001, with the creation of miniature black holes about half a year after his departure. This did not occur. An article published around the time he had predicted about miniature black holes created by CERN (a recurring theme, also ascribed to Fermilab and Brookhaven at various times)was taken by some to be evidence of this claim, but these events did not occur either.</p>\n<p>The civil war did not break out after the 2004 US presidential election, nor did conflicts or military involvement in 2012. World War III did not happen in 2015.</p>\n<p>Titor unambiguously claimed that the last Olympics would occur in 2004. While it is unclear if he meant the summer or winter Olympics, both have occurred since this time.</p>\n<p>However, because Titor asserted that the many-worlds interpretation was proved correct by his time, his predictions could refer to another timeline and not ours, making them unfalsifiable. This led to different interpretations, including that he had effectively accomplished his mission by creating another timeline (despite his supposed previous statements that it would be too difficult), or that he inadvertently travelled to a different timeline (ours) and mistook it as his own, or that all-time travel is pointless if the chaotic timeline would not cease to exist.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Story-and-consistency\"><a href=\"#Story-and-consistency\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Story and consistency\"></a>Story and consistency</h4><p>Potential contradictions have been observed in different Titor’s posts. In some of the posts, he claims that he was homeschooled, while in others he states that his basic education was conducted at the University of Florida. Similarly, he stated that he hid himself during the civil war in the U.S., while also stating in other instances that he fought in the war. In some posts, he claims that money is widely used and people still have credit cards, despite his statement that centralized banking no longer exists (this is either an inconsistency or implies the rise of private currencies).</p>\n<p>Titor’s story could also have been inspired by science fiction works. The use of an automobile as a time machine, for example, had been a key plot device in the popular 1985 movie Back to the Future and its sequels (as the DeLorean sports car), among others. Additionally, commentators have pointed out similarities between the Titor story and Pat Frank‘s classic post-apocalyptic science fiction novel Alas, Babylon. Among other similarities, Alas, Babylon takes place in a small river-side town in Florida just before and after a nuclear war and describes the struggle to survive as a family in the aftermath. In the book, the protagonist lives in the fictional town of “Fort Repose”, while Titor claimed to live in the “Fort”, formerly the University of Florida. The prediction of tiny black holes as a result of time travel (specifically, the sending back of information) is a key plot point from the 1980 novel Thrice Upon A Time by James P. Hogan.</p>\n<p>Some suggested that yet in the summer of 1998 before his posts, Titor sent two faxes to Art Bell’s radio program Coast to Coast AM, stating that “Y2K is a disaster. Many people freeze to death trying to get to warmer weather. The gov. tries to keep power by instituting martial law…” referring to popular legends of the time about the Y2K bug.</p>\n<p>In the online story, Titor stated that a part of his mission was to prevent the coming world war by changing history. Yet some claimed that during an IRC chat in October 2000, a month before he began posting, Titor was asked if the future could be changed from his predictions, and answered: “It’s too late … I just wish things didn’t have to happen the way they will.”</p>\n<h4 id=\"Technology\"><a href=\"#Technology\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Technology\"></a>Technology</h4><p>Titor provided an image of a detail of a supposed time machine, with a laser pointer beam “being bent by the gravitational field produced outside the vehicle by the distortion unit”. The beam being “bent” reveals an inconsistency of objects near the beam not appearing to be bent as well: the framing of the window visible in the background, for instance, should appear distorted in proximity to a large gravity gradient, but it does not. Some have speculated the “beam” is an optical fibre.</p>\n<p>Titor claimed that he was sent back to obtain an IBM 5100 because it could translate several types of computer code. According to IBM engineer Bob Dubke, Titor’s statements regarding the IBM 5100’s little-known ability to emulate and debug mainframe systems were correct. Supporters state that this information was not publicly available in 2000 or 2001 when Titor made his declaration, and Titor himself stated that this feature was “discovered” as late as 2036 when Unix, as the underlying source behind all computer operating systems still running local infrastructures and other computational tasks, was only two years away from no longer functioning due to 32-bit integer limitations. However, this emulation capability was widely known in the industry and commented on in-depth in numerous publications dealing with both the 5100 and programmable microcode in general. References to this were also available on the Internet as early as 1999 and therefore predated Titor’s postings.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Investigations\"><a href=\"#Investigations\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Investigations\"></a>Investigations</h4><p>An Italian television program, Voyager – Ai confini della conoscenza, aired the results of an investigation of John Titor on May 19, 2008. Private investigator Mike Lynch found no registry evidence, past or present, of any individual named John Titor. He did, however, identify the John Titor Foundation, a for-profit company formed on September 16, 2003, with no office or address other than a rented post box in Kissimmee, Florida. An IP address connected with Titor also geolocated to Kissimmee.</p>\n<p>In 2009, a report by John Hughston of the Hoax Hunter website named Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, as the CEO of the foundation. Lynch concluded that Haber and his brother Morey Haber, a computer scientist, were very likely the men behind John Titor, whom they introduced in 1998, accompanied by different predictions, including chaos due to the Y2K“bug”. John Hughston also reported that John Titor is a registered trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>\n<h4 id=\"In-popular-culture\"><a href=\"#In-popular-culture\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"In popular culture\"></a>In popular culture</h4><ul>\n<li>In 2003, the John Titor Foundation published a book, John Titor: A Time Traveler’s Tale (ISBN 1-59196-436-9), discussing his claims; the book is now out of print.</li>\n<li>In 2004, Time Traveler Zero, a play based on the John Titor story, was staged in the United States.</li>\n<li>The 2009 visual novel Steins; Gate, which was adapted into a critically acclaimed anime in 2011, is centred on John Titor and his theories.

As a child, Sid showed great interest in collecting random junk and assembling the pieces into working machines. Later as an adult, he became famous as the man who could fix anything that was broken.</p>\n<p>In 1934, Sid earned the distinction of being the first private appliance repairman in all of Canada. He was such a skilled technician that the local power company succeeded in taking him out of the army so he could develop the infrastructure of the public electrical utility.</p>\n<p>Sid Hurwich earned enough money to set up two successful companies of his own. He was still young when he got a heart attack, only 36 and he retired.</p>\n<h3 id=\"EXTRAORDINARY-TIME-MACHINE-THAT-COULD-‘FREEZE-TIME’\"><a href=\"#EXTRAORDINARY-TIME-MACHINE-THAT-COULD-‘FREEZE-TIME’\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"EXTRAORDINARY TIME MACHINE THAT COULD ‘FREEZE TIME’\"></a>EXTRAORDINARY TIME MACHINE THAT COULD ‘FREEZE TIME’</h3><p>However, he continued to experiment with technology and finally invented that extraordinary ‘freeze time’ machine that could also change the flow of time, and send out beams of influence to manipulate objects in distant locations.</p>\n<p>Local authorities had problems to catch thieves in the wave of bank robberies that swept Toronto in 1969. So Hurwich contacted them and said that is possible to freeze time to find out what happened.</p>\n<p>This account was given in the article in the Vancouver Sun-Times:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘All I recall,’ said Bolton (one of the police officers in charge), ‘is that it was under the table – the device, whatever it was – and there was a bedspread over the table. He froze my service revolver. You couldn’t pull the trigger, you couldn’t lift it off the table and even on the table you couldn’t pull the trigger.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and then Sid said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“…. Now take a look at your watches.” I remember one of them said, “When did this happen?” and I said, “The minute you walked through that door. You walked in there about 25 minutes ago. Now, look at your watches. You’re late about 25 minutes.”’ As the security officers filed out of his home, Sid’s wife overheard one of them suggest that the army should be told about the device. ‘That was the first time it entered my mind for war or army purposes or anything like that.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The time machine later was used by military and it ended up in Israel, accorded in publication Foreign Report in 1977. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The device sends out electronic rays to alter the natural composition of electronic fields and centres of gravity of weapons, instrument dials and mechanical devices … (using) the Hurwich principle there was no reason why the new beams could not reach and disable tanks, ground-to-ground missiles and complete radar systems. The beams could also be tacked together to form a screen that would make whole zones safe from bombs and missiles,”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But does they still have that device and do they still use it?</p>\n<h3 id=\"What-happened-to-Sid-Hurwich-and-his-time-altering-machine\"><a href=\"#What-happened-to-Sid-Hurwich-and-his-time-altering-machine\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What happened to Sid Hurwich and his time-altering machine?\"></a>What happened to Sid Hurwich and his time-altering machine?</h3><p>Whether the time machine is still in possession of the Israeli military or not has been widely debated. Does the Israeli military still have the Hurwich device, and are they still using it on ‘special occasions’ or in dire situations of military crisis?</p>\n<p>In ‘True Time Travel’ book by Richard Bullivant is written:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Skeptics say that if they had a device that could provide a kind of shield from bombs and missiles, freeze weapons, and even slow or halt time, the Israeli military would be invincible and would not have suffered as many casualties as it has in its decades’ long struggles with its antagonists in the Mideast. Others counter, however, by saying that the Hurwich device may be a two-edged sword. If it can ‘freeze’ the weapons of the enemy, it would also freeze the weapons of those employing the device. Thus, the device can perhaps only be used in a limited way – enough to knock out radar detection and other enemy electronics, for example – but not to induce the full-blown time-freeze effect for the benefit of the user.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not only Richard wrote about it, but and many people over the years. Also, he said to police that it is not a new invention, and it is designed on principles that are already well known.</p>\n<p>By now, researchers still can’t find out any information about him or his obituary. But, surely, he has passed on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Truth-or-Fake\"><a href=\"#Truth-or-Fake\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Truth or Fake\"></a>Truth or Fake</h2><p>Proof of time travel: Physicists says that theoretical time travel is possible on both sides means in the future and the past.

But the mystery remains unveiled is why there a figure that exactly looks like an astronaut engraved in the stone of a 16th-century cathedral?</p>\n<p>Built between 1513 and 1733 there is a new cathedral of Salamanca, Spain when space travel was hardly thought of. This has made some people curious to speculate about the origin of the carving: is this the evidence of time travel? Or some other creatures from different planet engraved it? Or is some paranormal force at a play?</p>\n<p>The Salamanca’s Astronaut is not a joke or a hoax, but a modern addition to the Cathedral; however, it has all the reserves of something which may provide confusion some 400 years from now. </p>\n<p><strong>New Cathedral Of Salamanca</strong><br>The building began at a time when the Gothic style was merging with the new Renaissance style. This cathedral retained more of its gothic counter because the administrators and the supervisors wanted the new cathedral to merge with the old one. Two elements were added that broke with the predominant style of the building: a Baroque and the bell tower.</p>\n<p>The new cathedral of Salamanca was erected without the destruction of the old cathedral, but the walls of the newly erected lean on the North wall of the old one. This is the reason why the old cathedral had to be reinforced. The main entrance to the cathedral consists of three decorated arcs: each heading to the three naves of the church.</p>\n<p><strong>Who Did Carve The Astronaut Picture On The Cathedral?</strong></p>\n<p>The truth behind this carving is, unfortunately, less interesting. When the church was rebuilt centuries ago it went a restoration program and the stonemasons decided to carve some modern figures. It is a tradition of the cathedral builders to add details or new carvings as a sort of some signature. In this case with the cathedral, quarryman Jeronimo Garcia given the action to add more images to the front of the building including an astronaut among some vines.</p>\n<p>There also been a weird looking dragon eating ice cream (even the ice cream cones were not invented until the 20th century), a bull, a crayfish and a lynx.

Many people have claimed this story to be true, so the crux of the problem pertains to Taured. One would notice that there is no country by the name of Taured, either today or during the purported time when the incident took place, i.e. the 1950s. The story ends with the man disappearing (forever) a day after arriving in Japan. Moreover, all of his documents, such as his passport and driver’s license also (conveniently) disappeared, thus making this strange story unsolvable.</p>\n<h4 id=\"The-Man’s-ArrivalThe-Man’s-Arrival\"><a href=\"#The-Man’s-ArrivalThe-Man’s-Arrival\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Man’s ArrivalThe Man’s Arrival\"></a>The Man’s ArrivalThe Man’s Arrival</h4><p>The story of the ‘Man from Taured’ begins quite specifically in many sources with a hot day in July 1954. On that particular day, a man was said to have arrived at Haneda Airport, known also as Tokyo International Airport. This man has been described as Caucasian looking with a beard. Whilst his primary language is said to have been French, it has been purported that he spoke Japanese and many other languages as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/Customs-service.jpg\" alt=\"Customs service\"><br>The sequence of events then differs according to which version of the story one encounters. In one version, this man hands over his passport to be stamped, and the Japanese immigration officer notices something strange. Whilst the passport looked authentic, the country where it was issued, ‘Taured’, was recognized as non-existent, either by the officer or one of his &#x2F; her colleagues, indicating that the man should be taken away for interrogation. In another version, the man mentioned that he was from Taured, and when the immigration officer did not believe him, he showed him&#x2F;her his passport.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Location-of-Taured\"><a href=\"#Location-of-Taured\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Location of Taured\"></a>Location of Taured</h4><p>The next part of the story details the man trying to convince the immigration officers that Taured does indeed exist. According to the traveller, Taured was located between France and Spain and had by then been in existence for 1000 years.</p>\n<p>When shown a map, the man pointed to the area occupied by the Principality of Andorra and was puzzled as to why his country was called Andorra on the map. Both sides refused to give in – the Japanese officers insisted that Taured did not exist, and the traveller argued otherwise.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/Location-of-Andorra.jpg\" alt=\"Location of Andorra\"><br><sup>Location of Andorra (center of green circle) in Europe  (dark grey).</sup></p>\n<h4 id=\"Vanished\"><a href=\"#Vanished\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Vanished!\"></a>Vanished!</h4><p>Eventually, the man was held by the officers, as they were suspicious that he might be some kind of criminal. They brought him to a nearby hotel for the night, whilst they conducted their investigation. To ensure that the man did not escape during the night, two guards were placed outside his room. The next morning, when the officers went to the man’s room, they realized that he had simply vanished, as there were no signs of his escape. Additionally, all of his documents, which may serve as evidence for the story’s validity, had disappeared as well.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Travel-Through-Time-or-Space-Or-Just-an-Exaggeration\"><a href=\"#Travel-Through-Time-or-Space-Or-Just-an-Exaggeration\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Travel Through Time or Space? Or Just an Exaggeration?\"></a>Travel Through Time or Space? Or Just an Exaggeration?</h4><p>One of the most notable explanations for this incident is that the man from Taured had somehow passed through a parallel dimension by accident, and ended up at Haneda Airport. It has been suggested that, based on this explanation, there is parallel earth which is similar to ours with the exception that the locations called Andorra here is known as Taured over there. Another suggestion is that the man was a time traveller from the future, thou this interpretation is arguably more problematic than the one supposing inter-dimensional travel.</p>\n<p>It has also been suggested that an incident like that did indeed happen, though perhaps much less sensational. This more mundane story could have been embellished each time it was told, so much so that it eventually evolved into the great mystery that it is known as today.</p>\n<p>Finally, it is also entirely possible that this story is merely an urban legend. The story of the ‘Man from Taured’ might not have even occurred in the first place, and may have just been the creation of someone’s imagination.</p>\n<h3 id=\"John-Titor\"><a href=\"#John-Titor\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"John Titor\"></a>John Titor</h3><p><img src=\"/images/posts/john-titor.jpg\" alt=\"John Titor\"><sup> Is this true that this person who was seen on <a href=\"/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-05#london-bridge-opening\">London Bridge Opening</a>.<br></sup></p>\n<p>One legendary hoax captivated fans of the supernatural and the paranormal like few others. November 2, 2000, saw the first online post by the individual who would come to be known as “John Titor.” Titor claimed to be a man from the future, sent to the past to retrieve… a portable computer. Though shrouded by forum avatars, his specific instructions on what he was here to accomplish, and what society would look like in his version of the future, kicked off a frenzy of investigation, speculation, and deception that has lasted for nearly two decades.</p>\n<p>Some people believed “John Titor” completely. Others became obsessed with errors and inconsistencies, digital detectives trying to uncover the truth behind the story. Before it was over, Titor would make his way to an animation studio in Japan, a wrestling ring in Pennsylvania, and a prison cell in Oregon.</p>\n<p>John Titor is a name used on several bulletin boards during 2000 and 2001 by a poster claiming to be an American military time traveller from 2036. Titor made numerous vague and specific predictions regarding calamitous events in 2004 and beyond, attracting world-wide attention during the ensuing decade. His descriptions of the aftermath of a nuclear war—including the devastation of numerous countries around the world, a breakup of the United States into five smaller sovereignties, and general destruction of the global environment and infrastructure—inspired fiction and music, and triggered investigations by journalists and others. Subsequent closer examination of Titor’s assertions provoked widespread scepticism. Inconsistencies in his explanations, the uniform inaccuracy of his predictions, and a private investigator’s findings all led to the general impression that the entire episode was an elaborate hoax. A 2009 investigation concluded that Titor was likely the creation of Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, along with his brother John, a computer scientist.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Titor’s-Post\"><a href=\"#Titor’s-Post\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Titor’s Post\"></a>Titor’s Post</h4><p>The first posts using John Titor’s military symbol appeared on the Time Travel Instituteforums on November 2, 2000, under the name TimeTravel_0. At that time the name “John Titor” was not being used. The posts discussed time travel in general, the first one being the “six parts” description of what a time machine would need to have to work (see below) and responses to questions about how such a machine would work. Early messages tended to be short. A second thread was also made due to shortcomings in the forum software at the time</p>\n<p>The name “John Titor” was not introduced until January 2001, when TimeTravel_0 began posting at the Art Bell BBS Forums (which required a name or pseudonym for every account). The Titor posts ended in late March 2001.</p>\n<p>Around 2003, various websites reproduced Titor’s posts, re-arranging them into narratives. Not all refer to the original dates posted.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/john-titor-ibm-5100.jpg\" alt=\"IBM-5100\"></p>\n<p>In his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from 2036, based in Tampa, Florida. He was assigned to a governmental time-travel project, and sent back to 1975 to retrieve an IBM 5100 computer which he said was needed to debug various legacy computer programs in 2036; a possible reference to the UNIX year 2038 problem. The IBM 5100 runs the APL and BASICprogramming languages.</p>\n<p>Titor had been selected for this mission specifically, given that his paternal grandfather was directly involved with the assembly and programming of the 5100. Titor claimed to be on a stopover in the year 2000 for “personal reasons,” to collect pictures lost in the (future) civil war and to visit his family, of whom he spoke often.</p>\n<p>Titor also said he had been, for a few months, trying to alert anyone that would listen about the threat of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease spread through beef products and about the possibility of civil war within the United States. When questioned about them by an online subscriber, Titor also expressed an interest in mysteries such as UFOs, which remained unexplained in his time. Titor suggested that UFOs and extraterrestrials might be travellers from much further into the future than his own time, with superior time machines.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Time-Machine\"><a href=\"#Time-Machine\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Time Machine\"></a>Time Machine</h4><p>Titor described his time machine on several occasions. In an early post, he described it as a “stationary mass, temporal displacement unit powered by two top-spin, dual positive singularities”, producing a “standard off-set Tipler sinusoid”.</p>\n<p>The earliest post was more explicit, saying it contained the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two magnetic housing units for the dual micro singularities</li>\n<li>An electron injection manifold to alter mass and gravity of the micro singularities</li>\n<li>A cooling and X-ray venting system</li>\n<li>Gravity sensors, or a variable gravity lock</li>\n<li>Four main caesium clocks</li>\n<li>Three main computer units</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the posts, the device was installed in the rear of a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette convertible and later moved to a 1987 truck having four-wheel drive.</p>\n<p>Titor shared several scans of the manual of a “C204 Time Displacement Unit” with diagrams and schematics and posted some photographs of the device installed in the car.</p>\n<p>Titor claimed that the “Everett–Wheeler model of quantum physics,” better known as the many-worlds interpretation, was correct. The model posits that every possible outcome of a quantum decision occurs in a separate “universe.” Titor stated that this was the reason the grandfather paradox would not happen; following the logic of the argument, Titor would be killing a different John Titor’s grandfather in a timeline other than his own.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The grandfather paradox is impossible.<br>In fact, all paradox is impossible. The Everett–Wheeler–Graham or multiple world theory is correct.<br>All possible quantum states, events, possibilities, and outcomes are real, eventual, and occurring.<br>The chances of everything happening someplace at some time in the supervise are 100%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"Predictions\"><a href=\"#Predictions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Predictions\"></a>Predictions</h4><p>Although invoking the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, whereby events from his timeline may differ from our own, Titor also expressed assurance that the differences were minimal. As such, his descriptions have been interpreted as predictions and compared with historical events since 2001.</p>\n<p>The most immediate of Titor’s predictions was of an upcoming civil war in the United States having to do with “order and rights”.He described it as beginning in 2004, with civil unrest surrounding the presidential election of that year. This civil conflict that he characterized as “having a Waco type event every month that steadily gets worse” would be “pretty much at everyone’s doorstep” and erupt by 2008.</p>\n<p>As a result of the war, the United States would split into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives. This civil war, according to Titor, would end in 2015 with a brief but intense World War III.</p>\n<p>Titor refers to the exchange as “N Day”. Washington, D.C. and Jacksonville, Florida are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, Omaha, Nebraska would be the new U.S. capital. Titor was vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point, he characterized the hostilities as being led by “border clashes and overpopulation”. He also pointed to the contemporary conflict between Arabs and Israel as not a cause, but rather a milestone that precedes World War III.</p>\n<p>Titor claimed that as a 13-year-old in 2011, he joined the Fighting Diamondbacks, a shotgun infantry unit in Florida, for at least four years. In other posts, he described himself as hiding from the war.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Criticism-and-discussion\"><a href=\"#Criticism-and-discussion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Criticism and discussion\"></a>Criticism and discussion</h4><p>As Titor gained significant attention, there also emerged analysis and discussion concerning the veracity of his claims about his origins and mission, and the future events he talked about. No John Titor or Titor family is known to exist, meaning that who posted as Titor used a pseudonym. The story has been called inconsistent as contradictions between statements at different times have been observed. Holding the many-worlds interpretation as correct, Titor claimed that his mission as a time traveller was to shape a timeline in which many chaotic events of his time, including World War III and the civil war in the US, never happened. In some supposed Titor’s appearances in the internet and other media segments before his main posts (notably in faxes to the radio talk show Coast to Coast AM in 1998), he stated that he was not able to change the future despite his efforts, suggesting one of the possible contradictions. Nevertheless, none of the specific events he predicted to a near future, chaotic or not, have come to happen (see below).</p>\n<p>Some issues with the technology have also been considered. In one of Titor’s pictures of a supposed time machine, a laser beam is seen allegedly being bent by gravitational distortion, but the view of nearby objects is not distorted as would be expected. Also, Titor knew about technical features of the IBM 5100 which were not available to the public at the time, albeit widely commented in the industry, suggesting he had some advanced understanding of the machine or computers in general.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Predictive-failures\"><a href=\"#Predictive-failures\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Predictive failures\"></a>Predictive failures</h4><p>One of Titor’s earliest assertions was that CERN would discover the basis for time travel sometime around 2001, with the creation of miniature black holes about half a year after his departure. This did not occur. An article published around the time he had predicted about miniature black holes created by CERN (a recurring theme, also ascribed to Fermilab and Brookhaven at various times)was taken by some to be evidence of this claim, but these events did not occur either.</p>\n<p>The civil war did not break out after the 2004 US presidential election, nor did conflicts or military involvement in 2012. World War III did not happen in 2015.</p>\n<p>Titor unambiguously claimed that the last Olympics would occur in 2004. While it is unclear if he meant the summer or winter Olympics, both have occurred since this time.</p>\n<p>However, because Titor asserted that the many-worlds interpretation was proved correct by his time, his predictions could refer to another timeline and not ours, making them unfalsifiable. This led to different interpretations, including that he had effectively accomplished his mission by creating another timeline (despite his supposed previous statements that it would be too difficult), or that he inadvertently travelled to a different timeline (ours) and mistook it as his own, or that all-time travel is pointless if the chaotic timeline would not cease to exist.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Story-and-consistency\"><a href=\"#Story-and-consistency\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Story and consistency\"></a>Story and consistency</h4><p>Potential contradictions have been observed in different Titor’s posts. In some of the posts, he claims that he was homeschooled, while in others he states that his basic education was conducted at the University of Florida. Similarly, he stated that he hid himself during the civil war in the U.S., while also stating in other instances that he fought in the war. In some posts, he claims that money is widely used and people still have credit cards, despite his statement that centralized banking no longer exists (this is either an inconsistency or implies the rise of private currencies).</p>\n<p>Titor’s story could also have been inspired by science fiction works. The use of an automobile as a time machine, for example, had been a key plot device in the popular 1985 movie Back to the Future and its sequels (as the DeLorean sports car), among others. Additionally, commentators have pointed out similarities between the Titor story and Pat Frank‘s classic post-apocalyptic science fiction novel Alas, Babylon. Among other similarities, Alas, Babylon takes place in a small river-side town in Florida just before and after a nuclear war and describes the struggle to survive as a family in the aftermath. In the book, the protagonist lives in the fictional town of “Fort Repose”, while Titor claimed to live in the “Fort”, formerly the University of Florida. The prediction of tiny black holes as a result of time travel (specifically, the sending back of information) is a key plot point from the 1980 novel Thrice Upon A Time by James P. Hogan.</p>\n<p>Some suggested that yet in the summer of 1998 before his posts, Titor sent two faxes to Art Bell’s radio program Coast to Coast AM, stating that “Y2K is a disaster. Many people freeze to death trying to get to warmer weather. The gov. tries to keep power by instituting martial law…” referring to popular legends of the time about the Y2K bug.</p>\n<p>In the online story, Titor stated that a part of his mission was to prevent the coming world war by changing history. Yet some claimed that during an IRC chat in October 2000, a month before he began posting, Titor was asked if the future could be changed from his predictions, and answered: “It’s too late … I just wish things didn’t have to happen the way they will.”</p>\n<h4 id=\"Technology\"><a href=\"#Technology\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Technology\"></a>Technology</h4><p>Titor provided an image of a detail of a supposed time machine, with a laser pointer beam “being bent by the gravitational field produced outside the vehicle by the distortion unit”. The beam being “bent” reveals an inconsistency of objects near the beam not appearing to be bent as well: the framing of the window visible in the background, for instance, should appear distorted in proximity to a large gravity gradient, but it does not. Some have speculated the “beam” is an optical fibre.</p>\n<p>Titor claimed that he was sent back to obtain an IBM 5100 because it could translate several types of computer code. According to IBM engineer Bob Dubke, Titor’s statements regarding the IBM 5100’s little-known ability to emulate and debug mainframe systems were correct. Supporters state that this information was not publicly available in 2000 or 2001 when Titor made his declaration, and Titor himself stated that this feature was “discovered” as late as 2036 when Unix, as the underlying source behind all computer operating systems still running local infrastructures and other computational tasks, was only two years away from no longer functioning due to 32-bit integer limitations. However, this emulation capability was widely known in the industry and commented on in-depth in numerous publications dealing with both the 5100 and programmable microcode in general. References to this were also available on the Internet as early as 1999 and therefore predated Titor’s postings.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Investigations\"><a href=\"#Investigations\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Investigations\"></a>Investigations</h4><p>An Italian television program, Voyager – Ai confini della conoscenza, aired the results of an investigation of John Titor on May 19, 2008. Private investigator Mike Lynch found no registry evidence, past or present, of any individual named John Titor. He did, however, identify the John Titor Foundation, a for-profit company formed on September 16, 2003, with no office or address other than a rented post box in Kissimmee, Florida. An IP address connected with Titor also geolocated to Kissimmee.</p>\n<p>In 2009, a report by John Hughston of the Hoax Hunter website named Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, as the CEO of the foundation. Lynch concluded that Haber and his brother Morey Haber, a computer scientist, were very likely the men behind John Titor, whom they introduced in 1998, accompanied by different predictions, including chaos due to the Y2K“bug”. John Hughston also reported that John Titor is a registered trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>\n<h4 id=\"In-popular-culture\"><a href=\"#In-popular-culture\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"In popular culture\"></a>In popular culture</h4><ul>\n<li>In 2003, the John Titor Foundation published a book, John Titor: A Time Traveler’s Tale (ISBN 1-59196-436-9), discussing his claims; the book is now out of print.</li>\n<li>In 2004, Time Traveler Zero, a play based on the John Titor story, was staged in the United States.</li>\n<li>The 2009 visual novel Steins; Gate, which was adapted into a critically acclaimed anime in 2011, is centred on John Titor and his theories. A civil war caused by SERN (the fictional version of CERN), due to their discovery of time travel, is covered as well.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"title":"Are We Living in Simulation Part 06","date":"2021-02-05T11:38:49.000Z","description":"Have you thought that there are internet mysteries too where some are been solved and some are not the internet is like an ocean where we don't know what will happen also we don't know who is spying on us what we search etc.","series":["World","Truth"],"cover":"/images/posts/cicada-3301.jpg","_content":"\n## Recap\n\nAs in [part 1](/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-01/), we have talked about **Quantum Computers**, **Facebook AI Chat**, and **Predictions of AI Robots** wherein [part 2](/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-02/) we had a recap of **part 1** and also **The Matrix** movie, **Roswell UFO Incident**, wherein [part 3](/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-03/) we discussed on [**MKUltra**](/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-03#MKUltra) performed by `US Central Intelligence Agency`, [`Black Mirror: Bandersnatch`](/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-03#Black-Mirror-Bandersnatch) movie where you can control **Stefan Butler** by given two choices which leads to a different path in the movies.

These puzzle games are easy to play and you are not going to face any issues or confusion for sure. But Cicada 3301 is something different from those types of puzzle games which you might have played in the past with your family members and relatives in your free time. On the year 4th January 2012, the mysterious and hardest puzzle on the internet was launched named “Cicada 3301”. It is one of the most mysterious and elaborate puzzles available today for people across the world.\n\nThe main purpose of the puzzles each year has been to carefully recruit the best and talented individuals. But the ultimate purpose is still not known to the people. As per some reviews, it has been stated that Cicada 3301 is mainly a secret society to improve privacy, cryptography, and anonymity. It would be better for you to understand that the name Cicada 3301 is given to a mysterious internet organization which has published sets of puzzle several times to recruit the most intelligent and fastest code breakers from all around the world. This puzzle was first published on sites like 4chan and Reddit and remains active for nearly a month. Do you want to know more about the Cicada 3301 and how it works? If yes is your answer, then here you would get all the information you are looking for right now!\n\n### What are the Points of Cicada 3301?\nThe main point of Cicada 3301 is to recruit highly intelligent and educated fast code breakers from all over the world through the sets of puzzles. They are looking for highly experienced and talented individuals. To search them, they have devised a test. Also, there is a message hidden in the image and you need to find them to reach them.\n\n### When did Cicada 3301 start?\n![Cicada 3301](/images/posts/cicada-3301.png)\n\nOn the year 4th of January 2012, the mysterious and hardest puzzle on the internet was launched named “Cicada 3301”. It is one of the most mysterious and elaborate puzzles available today for people worldwide. It is a puzzle where you need to have a good deal of technical knowledge, an understanding of number theory, including philosophy, classical music, knowledge of artist references, technological references, Mayan numerology, mathematics, cyberpunk literature, and the life cycles of cicadas. As per some speculations, Cicada 3301 is well-funded and large, considering that it has the deep knowledge to create such complex puzzles and at the same time, capable of supporting the existence of clues in a large number of locations, all far from one another.\n\nIn the year 2012, it was started, and then soon after one year, it again started for the people to solve the puzzles. There are thousands of people who have tried to solve the puzzle from their side but not able to do it due to a lack of intelligent and education skills. The puzzle looks similar to other online puzzles but very difficult to solve it. You should be well educated and highly intelligent for solving it easily without any problem. The mysterious organization Cicada 3301 has been releasing online encryptions since 2012, drawing top code-breakers to accept the challenges and nobody knows.\n\n### Who is Cicada 3301?\n\nCicada 3301 is a nickname given to an organization and it is not related to a particular person. All the set of puzzles to hire code breakers mainly focused on steganography, data security, cryptography, and even internet anonymity. Most people have claimed recently that Cicada 3301 is a secret society to improve anonymity, privacy, and cryptography. Some others have claimed that Cicada 3301 is a cult or religion. By considering the official statement of people who won the 2012 puzzle, 3301 uses non-puzzle based recruiting methods but created the puzzles because they were only looking for educated members with computer security and cryptography skills.\n\n### What is the mission of Cicada 3301?\n![Mission](/images/posts/mission-cicada-3301.jpeg)\n\nThe main mission of Cicada 3301 is still not known to the people due to its mysterious nature of work. As per some people reviews, it has been cleared that it is mainly for hiring intelligent and educated people in the organization. But the type of organization is still not known to the people and expected to be revealed very soon in the future for sure. This mysterious organization is trying to recruit the fastest and intelligent code breakers from all around the world.\n\n### What happens to those who solve cicada 3301?\n\nThose people who solve cicada 3301 still in a dilemma and they are not able to understand what is the main reason behind creating those puzzles. In a recent interview, Puzzle solvers have also mentioned the puzzles they have solved from their end and how it is not so easy for them in the beginning. It is an internet mystery and people are getting aware of it. Many folks have tried from their end but some of them become successful and some of them did not get much success in solving those highly complex problems. It is expected that soon a new puzzle set will be published on the site and people are waiting to try their luck. In the future, it has been cleared that people will show more excitement and eagerness to solve these puzzles, and soon we will come to know about some more people who are giving it a try for sure.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sepWhNGopg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### What was the purpose of Cicasa 3301?\n\nIt is normally believed that the results of solving the puzzle would lead the individuals to better know who these people are. As a participant, you are going to solve one puzzle and then another puzzle will be given to you with much-increasing difficulty level for sure. All the participants need to have high and strong knowledge regarding “Cryptography, coding, Steganography, Encryption, and many more. It is a famous mystery as people want to know who these people who have started this puzzle. Also, want to know the main reason behind hiring such intelligent individuals in a team. As per certain claims, it is believed it to be a secret society while others normally believed that Cicada 3301 is a religion or cult.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9z7LPBMHTg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAt the beginning of 2013, it was the time of round 3 puzzles. Once again the image includes the message and the message led to the book and also book led to the link. The procedure was the same as before but this time message led to the book named “ Liber Primus” ( First book). The book was written in Latin and originated from Russia. The book was a mystery for most people and many still not able to know the exact reason behind it. However, a significant portion of the book has yet to be translated. Out of 74 pages, only 19 pages have been successfully translated. From the year 2015 to now, no puzzles have been found but still internet users all around the world waiting for this mystery.\n\n### Conclusion\nFinally, you are aware of the Cicada 3301 and how it was solved by Joel and Marcus. All the above-mentioned points will help you in knowing what is Cicada 3301 and how it becomes an internet mystery for the users worldwide. You should note that the Cicada puzzle is not simple as most of the other puzzles available online and you need to be very educated and highly intelligent for solving the complex puzzles for sure.\n\nHere is the full solution of [Cicada 3301](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2nkG_LEeBQFu0m2bS5E1-EN3JgzpUe7g) puzzle.\n\n## r/A858DE45F56D9BC9\n![r/A858DE45F56D9BC9](/images/posts/r-A858DE45F56D9BC9.png)\n\n It all started back in 2011 when a Reddit account began posting an indecipherable sequence of numbers and letters to a new subreddit, r/A858DE45F56D9BC9, or [r/A858](http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9) for short. After languishing in Internet obscurity for nearly a year, another Reddit user requested more information, asking: \"Do these seemingly random strings of numbers ... correlate to something; is there some big joke I’m missing out on?\" There was no reply, but enough people began to wonder the same thing themselves, and soon a sister subreddit, r/Solving_A858, was born. It consisted of \"a dedicated group of computer science students, amateur cryptographers, and motivated enthusiasts\" working together to crack the code, if indeed that's what it was, reports the Daily Dot. At first, the creator kept the subreddit private, with only those proving themselves worthy allowed in, but it eventually opened to the public. It all started back in 2011 when a Reddit account began posting an indecipherable sequence of numbers and letters to a new subreddit, r/A858DE45F56D9BC9, or r/A858 for short. After languishing in Internet obscurity for nearly a year, another Reddit user requested more information, asking: \"Do these seemingly random strings of numbers ... correlate to something; is there some big joke I’m missing out on?\" There was no reply, but enough people began to wonder the same thing themselves, and soon a sister subreddit, [r/Solving_A858](https://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/), was born.

At first, the creator kept the subreddit private, with only those proving themselves worthy allowed in, but it eventually opened to the public.\n\n Today only a few of the thousands of r/A858 posts have been decoded, but they tend to be cryptic—such as an excerpt from the book Actions and Passions by Max Lerner and the ASCII image of Stonehenge, reported Bustle last year. The subreddit creator was pretty much silent until August 2015 when an account appeared in the sister \"solving\" subreddit that (after appropriate code-breaking, of course) allowed users to ask questions. Still, any answers were themselves cryptic, such as: \"We cannot disclose the purpose. A858 will end when the purpose is disclosed or discovered.\" Then on March 29, after having been private for some time (it switches between private and public regularly), r/A858 suddenly read: \"The A858 Project Has Concluded. You may unsubscribe.\" Many still think the project isn't over. \"I only hope A858 has a purpose,\" one user writes. \"I don’t particularly care if it is a good one.\"\n\n## India\n![India](https://alochonaa.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/india.jpg)\n\nIndia has been called the land of mysteries since time immemorial, whether for its various enigmatic natural phenomena or eccentricities associated with its religions and culture. And while science has worked hard to debunk and find a logical reason behind every riddle, there remain some that give rationalists a run for their money. Here are some of modern India’s most puzzling aspects that are bound to make your eyes pop!\n\n### Kodinhi – Kerala’s village of twins\n![Twin Town](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dC3fXAKSqsU/U5l3FHR6pfI/AAAAAAAABco/WbtxNtA_eLk/s1600/Kodinhi2.jpg)\n\nBy any metric, conceiving twins and triplets is a rare natural occurrence around the world. In fact, on average only 16 out of 1,000 successful pregnancies in the world result in twins and this average is even lower in India at just 9. However, this ratio is heavily skewed in the sleepy hamlet of Kodinhi in Kerala, which has a record 400 pairs of twins in a population of just over 2,000 families! Geneticists and scientists have long tried to explain this rare phenomenon but are only now making some headway. While experts have pointed to genetics as an obvious factor, what’s even more mysterious is that irrespective of religion, lineage or their original heritage, all families living in the village have conceived more than the average pairs of twins over the last few generations, and the number is consistently growing.\n\n### Tanjore’s Brihadeeswara Temple\n![Tanjore’s Brihadeeswara Temple](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jXTo2ZBydmk/WKX35fAuIoI/AAAAAAAAFRU/CHTrCTtdOlAIfaE2O0UY0S6WiaAReVQJwCLcB/s1600/Brihadeeswarar_Temple_Full_View.jpg)\n\nThe ‘Big Temple’ in Thanjavur is renowned across the world as an architectural marvel and is one of India’s 36 World Heritage Sites. While there are many imposing and majestic temples in Tamil Nadu, what makes this temple particularly interesting is its architectural mysteries that still confound many. The granite structure is popular for having one of the tallest gopurams in India and at the apex lies an 81-tonne monolithic Shikhara mounted at a height of 66 meters. While architecture and science have advanced over centuries to create much greater marvels, taken in the context of its era of construction, dating back more than 1,000 years, this aspect of the temple still baffles experts. Questions about how the heavy and huge Shikhara was mounted at such a height and how such massive amounts of granite were carried to the site with no recorded quarries in the vicinity are still unanswered. By some accounts, the tower is constructed in such a way that it does not cast a shadow at noon on any day of the year as well!\n\n### Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!\n![Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!](https://www.guioteca.com/cultura-india/files/2014/01/Prahlad-Jani.jpg)\n\nIndia is a land of eccentric saints and sadhus, but none of these gurus has raised worldwide interest and flummoxed experts as much as Prahlad Jani, the sadhu who claims to have fasted without food or water for over 40 years. His claims had long been taken with a pinch of salt by scientists and experts and outright dismissed by rationalists. However, in 2010, Jani was part of an extensive study by a team of 35 Indian experts from the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Science, which lasted over 15 days. While the study was shrouded in mystery with the government deciding not to divulge any details, it was widely publicised that the guru, also known as Mataji, was in good health despite not eating or drinking water and being in isolation for more than ten days. What’s more, it was further claimed that he did not urinate or excrete during the duration of the tests. While the veracity of this account is still an open question, it certainly has raised interest among the world’s leading experts.\n\n### Kirti Stambha – the Iron Pillar of Delhi\n![Kirti Stambha – the Iron Pillar of Delhi](https://i1.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Iron_pillar_delhi.jpg)\n\nWhile the concept of rust-resistant iron only became prominent during the industrial revolution in western civilization, there stands an iron pillar in Delhi that predates such known material technology by nearly a millennium! The Kirti Stambha or victory pillar of Delhi is a six-tonne structure that is constructed out of iron sometime in the 5th century and has stood the test of time without succumbing to rust.

These puzzle games are easy to play and you are not going to face any issues or confusion for sure. But Cicada 3301 is something different from those types of puzzle games which you might have played in the past with your family members and relatives in your free time. On the year 4th January 2012, the mysterious and hardest puzzle on the internet was launched named “Cicada 3301”. It is one of the most mysterious and elaborate puzzles available today for people across the world.\n\nThe main purpose of the puzzles each year has been to carefully recruit the best and talented individuals. But the ultimate purpose is still not known to the people. As per some reviews, it has been stated that Cicada 3301 is mainly a secret society to improve privacy, cryptography, and anonymity. It would be better for you to understand that the name Cicada 3301 is given to a mysterious internet organization which has published sets of puzzle several times to recruit the most intelligent and fastest code breakers from all around the world. This puzzle was first published on sites like 4chan and Reddit and remains active for nearly a month. Do you want to know more about the Cicada 3301 and how it works? If yes is your answer, then here you would get all the information you are looking for right now!\n\n### What are the Points of Cicada 3301?\nThe main point of Cicada 3301 is to recruit highly intelligent and educated fast code breakers from all over the world through the sets of puzzles. They are looking for highly experienced and talented individuals. To search them, they have devised a test. Also, there is a message hidden in the image and you need to find them to reach them.\n\n### When did Cicada 3301 start?\n![Cicada 3301](/images/posts/cicada-3301.png)\n\nOn the year 4th of January 2012, the mysterious and hardest puzzle on the internet was launched named “Cicada 3301”. It is one of the most mysterious and elaborate puzzles available today for people worldwide. It is a puzzle where you need to have a good deal of technical knowledge, an understanding of number theory, including philosophy, classical music, knowledge of artist references, technological references, Mayan numerology, mathematics, cyberpunk literature, and the life cycles of cicadas. As per some speculations, Cicada 3301 is well-funded and large, considering that it has the deep knowledge to create such complex puzzles and at the same time, capable of supporting the existence of clues in a large number of locations, all far from one another.\n\nIn the year 2012, it was started, and then soon after one year, it again started for the people to solve the puzzles. There are thousands of people who have tried to solve the puzzle from their side but not able to do it due to a lack of intelligent and education skills. The puzzle looks similar to other online puzzles but very difficult to solve it. You should be well educated and highly intelligent for solving it easily without any problem. The mysterious organization Cicada 3301 has been releasing online encryptions since 2012, drawing top code-breakers to accept the challenges and nobody knows.\n\n### Who is Cicada 3301?\n\nCicada 3301 is a nickname given to an organization and it is not related to a particular person. All the set of puzzles to hire code breakers mainly focused on steganography, data security, cryptography, and even internet anonymity. Most people have claimed recently that Cicada 3301 is a secret society to improve anonymity, privacy, and cryptography. Some others have claimed that Cicada 3301 is a cult or religion. By considering the official statement of people who won the 2012 puzzle, 3301 uses non-puzzle based recruiting methods but created the puzzles because they were only looking for educated members with computer security and cryptography skills.\n\n### What is the mission of Cicada 3301?\n![Mission](/images/posts/mission-cicada-3301.jpeg)\n\nThe main mission of Cicada 3301 is still not known to the people due to its mysterious nature of work. As per some people reviews, it has been cleared that it is mainly for hiring intelligent and educated people in the organization. But the type of organization is still not known to the people and expected to be revealed very soon in the future for sure. This mysterious organization is trying to recruit the fastest and intelligent code breakers from all around the world.\n\n### What happens to those who solve cicada 3301?\n\nThose people who solve cicada 3301 still in a dilemma and they are not able to understand what is the main reason behind creating those puzzles. In a recent interview, Puzzle solvers have also mentioned the puzzles they have solved from their end and how it is not so easy for them in the beginning. It is an internet mystery and people are getting aware of it. Many folks have tried from their end but some of them become successful and some of them did not get much success in solving those highly complex problems. It is expected that soon a new puzzle set will be published on the site and people are waiting to try their luck. In the future, it has been cleared that people will show more excitement and eagerness to solve these puzzles, and soon we will come to know about some more people who are giving it a try for sure.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sepWhNGopg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### What was the purpose of Cicasa 3301?\n\nIt is normally believed that the results of solving the puzzle would lead the individuals to better know who these people are. As a participant, you are going to solve one puzzle and then another puzzle will be given to you with much-increasing difficulty level for sure. All the participants need to have high and strong knowledge regarding “Cryptography, coding, Steganography, Encryption, and many more. It is a famous mystery as people want to know who these people who have started this puzzle. Also, want to know the main reason behind hiring such intelligent individuals in a team. As per certain claims, it is believed it to be a secret society while others normally believed that Cicada 3301 is a religion or cult.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9z7LPBMHTg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAt the beginning of 2013, it was the time of round 3 puzzles. Once again the image includes the message and the message led to the book and also book led to the link. The procedure was the same as before but this time message led to the book named “ Liber Primus” ( First book). The book was written in Latin and originated from Russia. The book was a mystery for most people and many still not able to know the exact reason behind it. However, a significant portion of the book has yet to be translated. Out of 74 pages, only 19 pages have been successfully translated. From the year 2015 to now, no puzzles have been found but still internet users all around the world waiting for this mystery.\n\n### Conclusion\nFinally, you are aware of the Cicada 3301 and how it was solved by Joel and Marcus. All the above-mentioned points will help you in knowing what is Cicada 3301 and how it becomes an internet mystery for the users worldwide. You should note that the Cicada puzzle is not simple as most of the other puzzles available online and you need to be very educated and highly intelligent for solving the complex puzzles for sure.\n\nHere is the full solution of [Cicada 3301](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2nkG_LEeBQFu0m2bS5E1-EN3JgzpUe7g) puzzle.\n\n## r/A858DE45F56D9BC9\n![r/A858DE45F56D9BC9](/images/posts/r-A858DE45F56D9BC9.png)\n\n It all started back in 2011 when a Reddit account began posting an indecipherable sequence of numbers and letters to a new subreddit, r/A858DE45F56D9BC9, or [r/A858](http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9) for short. After languishing in Internet obscurity for nearly a year, another Reddit user requested more information, asking: \"Do these seemingly random strings of numbers ... correlate to something; is there some big joke I’m missing out on?\" There was no reply, but enough people began to wonder the same thing themselves, and soon a sister subreddit, r/Solving_A858, was born. It consisted of \"a dedicated group of computer science students, amateur cryptographers, and motivated enthusiasts\" working together to crack the code, if indeed that's what it was, reports the Daily Dot. At first, the creator kept the subreddit private, with only those proving themselves worthy allowed in, but it eventually opened to the public. It all started back in 2011 when a Reddit account began posting an indecipherable sequence of numbers and letters to a new subreddit, r/A858DE45F56D9BC9, or r/A858 for short. After languishing in Internet obscurity for nearly a year, another Reddit user requested more information, asking: \"Do these seemingly random strings of numbers ... correlate to something; is there some big joke I’m missing out on?\" There was no reply, but enough people began to wonder the same thing themselves, and soon a sister subreddit, [r/Solving_A858](https://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/), was born. It consisted of \"a dedicated group of computer science students, amateur cryptographers, and motivated enthusiasts\" working together to crack the code, if indeed that's what it was, reports the Daily Dot. At first, the creator kept the subreddit private, with only those proving themselves worthy allowed in, but it eventually opened to the public.\n\n Today only a few of the thousands of r/A858 posts have been decoded, but they tend to be cryptic—such as an excerpt from the book Actions and Passions by Max Lerner and the ASCII image of Stonehenge, reported Bustle last year. The subreddit creator was pretty much silent until August 2015 when an account appeared in the sister \"solving\" subreddit that (after appropriate code-breaking, of course) allowed users to ask questions. Still, any answers were themselves cryptic, such as: \"We cannot disclose the purpose. A858 will end when the purpose is disclosed or discovered.\" Then on March 29, after having been private for some time (it switches between private and public regularly), r/A858 suddenly read: \"The A858 Project Has Concluded. You may unsubscribe.\" Many still think the project isn't over. \"I only hope A858 has a purpose,\" one user writes. \"I don’t particularly care if it is a good one.\"\n\n## India\n![India](https://alochonaa.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/india.jpg)\n\nIndia has been called the land of mysteries since time immemorial, whether for its various enigmatic natural phenomena or eccentricities associated with its religions and culture. And while science has worked hard to debunk and find a logical reason behind every riddle, there remain some that give rationalists a run for their money. Here are some of modern India’s most puzzling aspects that are bound to make your eyes pop!\n\n### Kodinhi – Kerala’s village of twins\n![Twin Town](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dC3fXAKSqsU/U5l3FHR6pfI/AAAAAAAABco/WbtxNtA_eLk/s1600/Kodinhi2.jpg)\n\nBy any metric, conceiving twins and triplets is a rare natural occurrence around the world. In fact, on average only 16 out of 1,000 successful pregnancies in the world result in twins and this average is even lower in India at just 9. However, this ratio is heavily skewed in the sleepy hamlet of Kodinhi in Kerala, which has a record 400 pairs of twins in a population of just over 2,000 families! Geneticists and scientists have long tried to explain this rare phenomenon but are only now making some headway. While experts have pointed to genetics as an obvious factor, what’s even more mysterious is that irrespective of religion, lineage or their original heritage, all families living in the village have conceived more than the average pairs of twins over the last few generations, and the number is consistently growing.\n\n### Tanjore’s Brihadeeswara Temple\n![Tanjore’s Brihadeeswara Temple](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jXTo2ZBydmk/WKX35fAuIoI/AAAAAAAAFRU/CHTrCTtdOlAIfaE2O0UY0S6WiaAReVQJwCLcB/s1600/Brihadeeswarar_Temple_Full_View.jpg)\n\nThe ‘Big Temple’ in Thanjavur is renowned across the world as an architectural marvel and is one of India’s 36 World Heritage Sites. While there are many imposing and majestic temples in Tamil Nadu, what makes this temple particularly interesting is its architectural mysteries that still confound many. The granite structure is popular for having one of the tallest gopurams in India and at the apex lies an 81-tonne monolithic Shikhara mounted at a height of 66 meters. While architecture and science have advanced over centuries to create much greater marvels, taken in the context of its era of construction, dating back more than 1,000 years, this aspect of the temple still baffles experts. Questions about how the heavy and huge Shikhara was mounted at such a height and how such massive amounts of granite were carried to the site with no recorded quarries in the vicinity are still unanswered. By some accounts, the tower is constructed in such a way that it does not cast a shadow at noon on any day of the year as well!\n\n### Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!\n![Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!](https://www.guioteca.com/cultura-india/files/2014/01/Prahlad-Jani.jpg)\n\nIndia is a land of eccentric saints and sadhus, but none of these gurus has raised worldwide interest and flummoxed experts as much as Prahlad Jani, the sadhu who claims to have fasted without food or water for over 40 years. His claims had long been taken with a pinch of salt by scientists and experts and outright dismissed by rationalists. However, in 2010, Jani was part of an extensive study by a team of 35 Indian experts from the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Science, which lasted over 15 days. While the study was shrouded in mystery with the government deciding not to divulge any details, it was widely publicised that the guru, also known as Mataji, was in good health despite not eating or drinking water and being in isolation for more than ten days. What’s more, it was further claimed that he did not urinate or excrete during the duration of the tests. While the veracity of this account is still an open question, it certainly has raised interest among the world’s leading experts.\n\n### Kirti Stambha – the Iron Pillar of Delhi\n![Kirti Stambha – the Iron Pillar of Delhi](https://i1.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Iron_pillar_delhi.jpg)\n\nWhile the concept of rust-resistant iron only became prominent during the industrial revolution in western civilization, there stands an iron pillar in Delhi that predates such known material technology by nearly a millennium! The Kirti Stambha or victory pillar of Delhi is a six-tonne structure that is constructed out of iron sometime in the 5th century and has stood the test of time without succumbing to rust. The science of this pillar has baffled scientists, primarily for the fact that such advanced technology for rust resistance was thought to be unknown elsewhere in the world at the time.\n","slug":"Are-We-Living-In-Simulation-Part-06","published":1,"updated":"2025-01-10T03:40:13.640Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cm5uu6j5k000bt3yrel1z7c0b","content":"<h2 id=\"Recap\"><a href=\"#Recap\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Recap\"></a>Recap</h2><p>As in <a href=\"/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-01/\">part 1</a>, we have talked about <strong>Quantum Computers</strong>, <strong>Facebook AI Chat</strong>, and <strong>Predictions of AI Robots</strong> wherein <a href=\"/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-02/\">part 2</a> we had a recap of <strong>part 1</strong> and also <strong>The Matrix</strong> movie, <strong>Roswell UFO Incident</strong>, wherein <a href=\"/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-03/\">part 3</a> we discussed on <a href=\"/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-03#MKUltra\"><strong>MKUltra</strong></a> performed by <code>US Central Intelligence Agency</code>, <a href=\"/post/Are-We-Living-in-Simulation-Part-03#Black-Mirror-Bandersnatch\"><code>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</code></a> movie where you can control <strong>Stefan Butler</strong> by given two choices which leads to a different path in the movies.

Geneticists and scientists have long tried to explain this rare phenomenon but are only now making some headway.

While there are many imposing and majestic temples in Tamil Nadu, what makes this temple particularly interesting is its architectural mysteries that still confound many. The granite structure is popular for having one of the tallest gopurams in India and at the apex lies an 81-tonne monolithic Shikhara mounted at a height of 66 meters. While architecture and science have advanced over centuries to create much greater marvels, taken in the context of its era of construction, dating back more than 1,000 years, this aspect of the temple still baffles experts. Questions about how the heavy and huge Shikhara was mounted at such a height and how such massive amounts of granite were carried to the site with no recorded quarries in the vicinity are still unanswered. By some accounts, the tower is constructed in such a way that it does not cast a shadow at noon on any day of the year as well!</p>\n<h3 id=\"Prahlad-Jani-–-India’s-fasting-fakir\"><a href=\"#Prahlad-Jani-–-India’s-fasting-fakir\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!\"></a>Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!</h3><p><img src=\"https://www.guioteca.com/cultura-india/files/2014/01/Prahlad-Jani.jpg\" alt=\"Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!\"></p>\n<p>India is a land of eccentric saints and sadhus, but none of these gurus has raised worldwide interest and flummoxed experts as much as Prahlad Jani, the sadhu who claims to have fasted without food or water for over 40 years. His claims had long been taken with a pinch of salt by scientists and experts and outright dismissed by rationalists. However, in 2010, Jani was part of an extensive study by a team of 35 Indian experts from the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Science, which lasted over 15 days. While the study was shrouded in mystery with the government deciding not to divulge any details, it was widely publicised that the guru, also known as Mataji, was in good health despite not eating or drinking water and being in isolation for more than ten days. What’s more, it was further claimed that he did not urinate or excrete during the duration of the tests.

While architecture and science have advanced over centuries to create much greater marvels, taken in the context of its era of construction, dating back more than 1,000 years, this aspect of the temple still baffles experts. Questions about how the heavy and huge Shikhara was mounted at such a height and how such massive amounts of granite were carried to the site with no recorded quarries in the vicinity are still unanswered. By some accounts, the tower is constructed in such a way that it does not cast a shadow at noon on any day of the year as well!</p>\n<h3 id=\"Prahlad-Jani-–-India’s-fasting-fakir\"><a href=\"#Prahlad-Jani-–-India’s-fasting-fakir\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!\"></a>Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!</h3><p><img src=\"https://www.guioteca.com/cultura-india/files/2014/01/Prahlad-Jani.jpg\" alt=\"Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!\"></p>\n<p>India is a land of eccentric saints and sadhus, but none of these gurus has raised worldwide interest and flummoxed experts as much as Prahlad Jani, the sadhu who claims to have fasted without food or water for over 40 years. His claims had long been taken with a pinch of salt by scientists and experts and outright dismissed by rationalists. However, in 2010, Jani was part of an extensive study by a team of 35 Indian experts from the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Science, which lasted over 15 days. While the study was shrouded in mystery with the government deciding not to divulge any details, it was widely publicised that the guru, also known as Mataji, was in good health despite not eating or drinking water and being in isolation for more than ten days. What’s more, it was further claimed that he did not urinate or excrete during the duration of the tests. While the veracity of this account is still an open question, it certainly has raised interest among the world’s leading experts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Kirti-Stambha-–-the-Iron-Pillar-of-Delhi\"><a href=\"#Kirti-Stambha-–-the-Iron-Pillar-of-Delhi\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Kirti Stambha – the Iron Pillar of Delhi\"></a>Kirti Stambha – the Iron Pillar of Delhi</h3><p><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Iron_pillar_delhi.jpg\" alt=\"Kirti Stambha – the Iron Pillar of Delhi\"></p>\n<p>While the concept of rust-resistant iron only became prominent during the industrial revolution in western civilization, there stands an iron pillar in Delhi that predates such known material technology by nearly a millennium! The Kirti Stambha or victory pillar of Delhi is a six-tonne structure that is constructed out of iron sometime in the 5th century and has stood the test of time without succumbing to rust. The science of this pillar has baffled scientists, primarily for the fact that such advanced technology for rust resistance was thought to be unknown elsewhere in the world at the time.</p>\n"},{"title":"South Korea's 'artificial sun' sets new world record, lights up at 100 million degrees for record 20 seconds","date":"2020-12-30T11:34:29.000Z","description":"A superconducting fusion device, also known as the Korean artificial sun, set the new world record as it successfully maintained high temperature over 100 million degrees (Celsius) for a record 20 seconds.","draft":false,"hideToc":false,"enableToc":true,"enableTocContent":false,"author":"Siddh Mistry","authorEmoji":"🤯","url":"/artificial-sun/","pinned":false,"series":["World"],"cover":"images/posts/kepler-planets-dual-sun.jpg","_content":"\n## KSTAR\n\n![Korea KSTAR](/images/posts/korea-KSTAR.jpg)**Credit: National Research Council of Science & Techonology**\n\n`Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR)` conducted a superconducting fusion device also known as `Korean Artificial Sun`, set the new world record of recording the high temperature plasma for `20 seconds` with an ion temperature over `100 million degrees (Celsius).`\n\n\n\nThis reading were been taken on 24<sup>th</sup> November (Tuesday), KSTAR Research Center at the `Korea Institute of Fusion Energy (KFE)` announced that  in a joint research with the `Seoul National University (SNU)` and `Columbia University` of the United States succeeded in continuous operation of plasma for 20 second with an ion-temperature higher then 100 million degrees, which one of the core condition of nuclear fusion in the 2020 KSTAR Plasma Campaign.\n\n\n\nIt was an achievement to extend the 8 second plasma operation time during the 2019 KSTAR Plasma Campaign by more then 2 times.

Together, these steps can play a significant role, changing the course of this virus. Thank you to President Trump,” she said.</p>\n"},{"title":"Facing new outbreaks, China places over 22 million on lockdown","date":"2021-01-14T13:20:27.000Z","description":"They locked down two cities with more than 17 mn people, Shijiazhuang and Xingtai.

Local officials there had gone ahead with a `Communist Party` conference like the one now canceled in `Hebei`, despite knowing the risk of the disease spreading among people.\n\n\n\nSince Wuhan, authorities have created a playbook that mobilizes party cadres to quickly respond to new outbreaks by sealing off neighborhoods, conducting widespread testing and quarantining large groups when needed.\n\n\n\n> “In the process of infectious disease prevention and control, one of the key points is to seek truth from facts, to openly and transparently release epidemic information and never to allow covering up or underreporting,” the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, said at a meeting Friday of the State Council, China’s Cabinet.\n\n\n\n`China, a country of 1.4 billion people`, has `reported` an average of `109 new cases` a day over the past week, according to a `New York Times database`.

They ordered a crash testing regime of nearly every resident there, which was completed in a matter of days.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They shut down transportation and canceled weddings, funerals </p>\n<p>and, most significantly, a provincial Communist Party conference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By this week the lockdowns expanded to include another city on the <code>edge of Beijing</code>, <code>Langfang</code>, as well as a county in <code>Heilongjiang</code>, a northeastern province. Districts in Beijing itself, <code>the Chinese capital</code>, also shut down.</p>\n<p><code>More than 22 million people</code> in all have been ordered to remain inside their homes — double the number affected in <code>January 2020</code> when <code>China’s central government locked down Wuhan</code>, the central city where the virus was first reported, in a move that was then seen as extraordinary.</p>\n<p>The flare-ups remain small compared with the devastation facing other countries, but they threaten to undercut the success the country’s Communist Party has had in subduing the virus, allowing its economy to surge back after last year’s slump and its people to return to something close to normal lives.</p>\n<p>The urgency of the government’s current response stands in contrast to that of officials in <code>Wuhan</code> last year who feared a backlash if they disclosed the <code>mysterious new illnesses</code> then emerging. Local officials there had gone ahead with a <code>Communist Party</code> conference like the one now canceled in <code>Hebei</code>, despite knowing the risk of the disease spreading among people.</p>\n<p>Since Wuhan, authorities have created a playbook that mobilizes party cadres to quickly respond to new outbreaks by sealing off neighborhoods, conducting widespread testing and quarantining large groups when needed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In the process of infectious disease prevention and control, one of the key points is to seek truth from facts, to openly and transparently release epidemic information and never to allow covering up or underreporting,” the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, said at a meeting Friday of the State Council, China’s Cabinet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>China, a country of 1.4 billion people</code>, has <code>reported</code> an average of <code>109 new cases</code> a day over the past week, according to a <code>New York Times database</code>. Those would be welcome numbers in countries experiencing far worse — including the United States, which is averaging more than <code>250,000 new cases a day</code> — but they are the worst in China since last summer.</p>\n<p><code>China’s National Health Commission</code> has not reported any new deaths, but the <code>World Health Organization</code>, which uses information from China, has <code>recorded 12 so far in 2021</code>. The National Health Commission did not respond to requests to explain the discrepancy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Hebei, the province where the new outbreak has been concentrated, officials last week declared a “wartime state” that shows no sign of lifting soon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Throughout the pandemic, officials have appeared especially worried about Beijing, home of the Communist Party’s central leadership. Last week, the <code>party secretary in Hebei, Wang Dongfeng,</code> pledged to make sure the province was <code>“the moat to safeguard Beijing’s political security.”</code></p>\n<p>The outbreaks, coming after so long with minimal cases, have increased anxiety across China, where residents in most places felt like the pandemic was a thing of the past.</p>\n<p><code>New cases</code> have also been reported in the <code>northern province of Shanxi</code> and the northeastern provinces of <code>Heilongjiang and Jilin</code>. Shanghai on Wednesday urged residents not to leave the city and announced that people who had traveled to risky areas should quarantine themselves at home for two weeks and leave only after passing two tests, while those who had traveled to the <code>highest-risk areas</code> faced quarantine in government facilities.</p>\n<p>In Wuhan, <code>rumors swirled</code> that the city could face a <code>new lockdown</code>; while those appeared unfounded, officials noticeably stepped up temperature checks on some streets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Shunyi, a district in Beijing’s northeast that includes Beijing Capital International Airport as well as rural villages, residents have been ordered to remain inside since a surge of cases just before the new year. At Beijing’s main railroad stations, workers sprayed down public spaces with disinfectant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After a <code>taxi driver tested positive</code> over the weekend in <code>Beijing</code>, authorities tracked down <code>144 passengers</code> for additional tests, according to The Global Times, a state tabloid. <code>Now anyone getting in a taxi or car service in Beijing has to scan a QR code from their phone, allowing the government to quickly trace them.</code></p>\n<p>The government has moved ahead on plans to <code>vaccinate 50 million people</code> ahead of the <code>Lunar New Year next month</code>, a holiday when hundreds of millions of people traditionally crisscross the country to visit their families. By Wednesday, more than <code>10 million doses had been distributed</code>.</p>\n<p>Even with the vaccinations, officials have already warned people not to travel ahead of the holiday.</p>\n<p><code>“These measures, if well implemented, can ensure that no large-scale epidemic rebound occurs,”</code> Feng Zijian, the deputy director of China’s Center for Disease Control, said at a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>While the new restrictions have inconvenienced millions, there appears to be no significant public resistance to them.</p>\n<p><code>“As far as I am concerned, I think measures like a lockdown for the whole city are actually quite good,”</code> said Zhao Zhengyu, a university student in Beijing who is now confined to her parents’ home in Shijiazhuang, where she was visiting during winter break when the outbreak there erupted.</p>\n<p>Many in the city feared a repeat of Wuhan’s lockdown, but she sounded unfazed.</p>\n<p>Zhao’s parents now work from home, picking up groceries only from a market in their residential compound.

Think of it as locking the doors to your digital life. Whether it’s protecting personal data, avoiding fraud, or using technology responsibly, staying secure online is essential in today’s fast-paced digital age. In this guide, we’ll explore simple yet effective steps you can take to safeguard yourself and your loved ones from cyber threats.  \n\nThe internet has made our lives easier in so many ways. We shop online, manage our bank accounts, connect with friends, and even work remotely. But unfortunately, hackers and scammers are constantly looking for ways to take advantage of us.  \n\nThe good news? You don’t have to be a tech expert to protect yourself online. With a few simple habits, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to cybercrimes. Let’s break it down!  \n\n---\n\n### **1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords**  \n![Strong Password](https://media.wired.com/photos/641e1a1b43ffd37beea02cdf/4:3/w_4497,h_3373,c_limit/Best%20Password%20Managers%20Gear%20GettyImages-1408198405.png)\nThink of your password as the lock on your front door. A weak password is like leaving your door unlocked. Here’s how to make a strong one:  \n- Use at least 12 characters.  \n- Mix letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.  \n- Don’t reuse passwords across different accounts.  \n\n👉 **Tip:** Use a password manager app (like LastPass or Dashlane) to remember them for you.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Double-Check Before You Click**\n![Double Checl](https://kajabi-storefronts-production.kajabi-cdn.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/sites/45147/images/ypn2Dpe5RPS6CuDNuaIO_Think_before_you_click.jpg)\nHave you ever received an email or message asking you to click a link or download something? Scammers often use tricks like this to steal your information.  \n- If you don’t know the sender, don’t click!  \n- Check for oddities in the email, like misspellings or unusual requests.  \n\n👉 **Tip:** If an email claims to be from your bank or a company, visit their website directly instead of using the link in the email.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Keep Everything Updated**  \n![Update](https://cdn.appuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/intro-2.jpg)\nYour devices and apps often release updates to fix security issues. If you skip these updates, hackers might find ways to break in.  \n- Turn on automatic updates for your phone, computer, and apps.  \n- Update antivirus software regularly (it’s like a digital security guard).  \n\n👉 **Tip:** If you see a notification about updates, don’t delay—do it right away!  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Watch What You Share Online**  \n![Watch Online](https://bpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.uoregon.edu/dist/2/2871/files/2013/08/shutterstock_58591429-22qa8k2.jpg)\nSocial media is fun, but sharing too much can be risky. Hackers use personal details like your birthday, pet’s name, or school name to guess passwords or trick you.  \n- Avoid posting private information, like your address or travel plans.  \n- Be cautious about what you share in public profiles.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Use Two-Step Verification**  \n![Two-Step Verification](https://businessresources.bitdefender.com/hubfs/Josue_MFA.jpg)\nThis is like adding a second lock to your door. Even if someone steals your password, they can’t get in without a second step, like a code sent to your phone.  \n- Look for “Two-Factor Authentication” or “2FA” in your account settings.  \n\n👉 **Tip:** Use apps like Google Authenticator instead of relying on text messages for these codes.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Stay Alert to Scams**  \n![Scam Alert](https://benchmarkfcu.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Scam-Alert_v2.jpg)\nScammers are smart, but you can outsmart them. Here’s what to watch for:  \n- **Fake calls or texts:** If someone claims to be from your bank or a company and asks for sensitive information, hang up and call the company directly.  \n- **Too-good-to-be-true offers:** If it feels too good to be true, it probably is.  \n\n---\n\n### **7. Secure Your Wi-Fi at Home**  \n![Wi-Fi Security](https://us.norton.com/content/dam/blogs/images/norton/am/evil-twin-attack-explained-anim.gif)\nYour Wi-Fi connects all your devices, so it’s important to keep it safe.  \n- Change the default password on your router to something only you know.  \n- Use a strong Wi-Fi password, not something easy like “password123.”  \n\n---\n\n### **8. Check Your Bank Statements**  \n![Online Banking](https://www.worldbank.org.ge/files/2020/05/future-of-banks.jpg)\nHackers sometimes make small charges on your credit card to test if it works before taking more.  \n- Review your statements every month.  \n- Set up alerts for unusual activity.  \n\n👉 **Tip:** If you see a charge you don’t recognize, report it to your bank immediately.  \n\n---\n\n### **9. Back Up Your Data**  \n![Backup Data](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/B3ek5KLwgHiMpi8HnT2KZrgnv28=/2120x1414/filters:fill(auto,1)/GettyImages-962574588-d07e325236e84e23971c5f6d5079775e.jpg)\nImagine losing all your photos, documents, or contacts—terrifying, right? Backing up your data keeps it safe.  \n- Use an external hard drive or a cloud service like Google Drive or iCloud.  \n- Back up important files regularly.  \n\n---\n\n### **10. Stay Informed**  \n![Stay informed](https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/538853/newspaper-headlined-breaking-news.jpg)\nCybercriminals are always finding new tricks. By staying informed, you can stay ahead of them.  \n- Follow trusted websites or news sources about online safety.  \n- Share tips with your friends and family to help them stay safe too.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**  \nOnline security doesn’t have to be complicated. Small steps like using strong passwords, keeping your software updated, and being cautious about what you click can go a long way.  \n\nIf something feels suspicious, trust your instincts. It’s better to be safe than sorry. By staying alert and following these tips, you can enjoy the benefits of the digital world without falling victim to hackers and frauds.  \n\n💡 **Remember:** Staying safe online is a habit.

Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene.","cover":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t-MDoI7MuY0/maxresdefault.jpg","series":["World"],"_content":"![Face Detection](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t-MDoI7MuY0/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\n## What is Face Detection?\n\nFace detection is AI-based computer technology that is used to extract and identify human faces from digital images. When integrated with [biometric](https://recfaces.com/articles/what-is-biometrics) security systems (particularly, facial recognition ones), this kind of technology is what makes it possible to monitor and track people in real-time. In applications that use facial tracking, analysis, and recognition, face detection typically works as the first step and has a significant impact on how sequential operations within the app will perform.\n\nFace detection helps with facial analysis by identifying the parts of a video or an image that should be focused on when determining gender, age, and emotions. Similarly, with facial recognition systems (which create “faceprint” maps of facial features), face detection data is included in the system’s algorithms. And why? Face detection helps determine which parts of the video or image are needed to produce a faceprint.\n\n## HOW DOES FACE DETECTION WORK?\n\nFace detection technology uses machine learning and algorithms in order to extract human faces from larger images; such images typically contain plenty of non-face objects, such as buildings, landscapes, and various body parts.\n\nFacial detection algorithms usually begin by seeking out human eyes, which are one of the easiest facial features to detect. Next, the algorithm might try to find the mouth, nose, eyebrows, and iris. After identifying these facial features, and the algorithm concludes that it has extracted a face, it then goes through additional tests to confirm that it is, indeed, a face.\n\nTo make algorithms as accurate as possible, they must be trained with huge data sets that contain hundreds of thousands of images. Some of these images contain faces, while others do not. The training procedures help the algorithm’s ability to decide whether an image contains faces, and where those facial regions are located.\n\nAlso, now would be a good time to give you definitions of the main types of algorithms – ML, AI, and Deep Learning.\n\n* **Machine Learning (ML)**: ML algorithms use statistics to find patterns in huge amounts of data. This data can include words, numbers, images, clicks, and more. ML is the process behind many modern services – voice assistants (Siri and Alexa), search engines (Google and Baidu), and recommendation systems (Spotify and Netflix);\n* **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: If an ML solution is programmed to learn how to perform a task, rather than just simple performance, then it is AI. Systems that use AI demonstrate behaviors similar to human intelligence – for instance, problem solving, planning, learning, perception, manipulation, and reasoning;\n* **Deep Learning:** This algorithm is a subset of machine learning, and it is what forms deep neural networks; essentially, machines are given a greater ability to find and amplify tiny patterns. Such networks have any layers of computational nodes that collaborate to sift through data and deliver predictions.\n\nNow, as for the exact technologies used to develop face detection applications; these include:\n\n* OpenCV;\n* Matlab;\n* Tensorflow;\n* Neural Networks.\n\nAll of these follow almost the exact same procedure for face detection.\n\n### FACE DETECTION METHODS\n\nThree researchers from the University of California, David Kriegman, Ming-Hsuan Yang, and Narendra Ahuja, published a classification of facial detection methods. There are four classifiable categories, of which face detection algorithms can belong to 2+ groups. Let’s take a look at each category.\n\n#### Feature-Based Method\n\nThis method located faces by extracting structural features. First, an algorithm is trained as a classifier. Next, it is used to sort facial regions from non-facial regions. The general idea is to move past humans’ instinctive knowledge of faces. When feature-based approaches tackle photos with many faces, they have a 94% success rate.\n\n**Summary:** Features such as a person’s nose or eyes are used to detect a face.\n\n#### Knowledge-Based Method\n\nA knowledge-based algorithm is dependent upon a set of rules, and it is built on human knowledge. For instance, “rules” might include that a face should have eyes, a nose, and a mouth in certain positions relative to each other. However, this kind of method comes with one huge challenge: it is very difficult to build an appropriate rules set. If the rules are too general, there may be many false positives – and, conversely, if the rules are too detailed, the system could generate many false negatives.\n\n**Summary:** A face is determined based on whether it meets a set of rules made by a human.\n\n#### Template Matching Method\n\nWith a template matching algorithm, parameterized or pre-defined templates are used to locate or detect faces – the system measures the correlation between the input photos and the templates. For instance, the template may show that a human face is divided into nose, mouth, eyes, and face contour regions. Also, a facial model could be comprised of just edges and use the edge detection method – implementation of this approach is easy, but it is insufficient for face detection.\n\n**Summary:** Images are compared to standard face patterns that have been previously stored.\n\n#### Appearance-Based Method\n\nAn appearance-based algorithm uses a set of training images to “learn” what a face should look like. In general, this method relies on machine learning and statistical analysis to determine relevant facial characteristics. An appearance-based approach is generally considered to be stronger than the previously mentioned methods.\n\n**Summary:** Statistical analysis and machine learning are combined to find a face image’s characteristics.\n\n### FACE DETECTION TECHNIQUES\n\nSome of the more specific facial detection techniques include:\n\n1. Removing the background. Let’s say an image has a pre-defined, static background or a plain, single-color background – removing it can help determine the face’s boundaries;\n2. With color images, the color of the skin can sometimes be used to find faces;\n3. Motion can be used to detect faces. In a real-time video, a person’s face is nearly always in motion. However, a drawback of this technique is that a face could be confused with other moving objects.\n\nWhen the aforementioned strategies are combined, they can create a comprehensive face detection approach.\n\n## WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES IN FACE DETECTION?\n\nResearchers Ashu Kumar, Amandeep Kaur, and Munish Kumar published a [review of face detection techniques](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326667118_Face_Detection_Techniques_A_Review), which included a detailed explanation of the challenges that facial detection faces. To sum up their findings, the challenges in face detection include:\n\n* Odd expressions. A human face might have an odd expression, making it difficult for facial detection algorithms to identify it as a face;\n* Face occlusion. If a face is hidden by hair, a hat, a hand, glasses, or a scarf, it may result in a false negative;\n* Illuminations. An image might not have uniform lighting effects; part of the image may be overexposed, while another part is very dark. Again, this can contribute to false negatives;\n* Complex background. When lots of objects are present in an image, face detection’s accuracy is reduced;\n* Too many faces. If there is a large number of human faces in an image, face detection software may have a hard time distinguishing between some of them;\n* Low resolution. If an image’s resolution is poor, it is more difficult to detect faces;\n* Skin color. If somebody’s skin color falls outside of the gradient that is recognized by the algorithm,\n  their face might not be detected.\n\n## HOW DOES FACE DETECTION WORK WITH DEEP LEARNING?\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, deep learning is a subset of machine learning in which large neural networks process huge amounts of data and make complex predictions. So how does deep learning factor into face detection? Well, multiple [deep learning methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02766) have been developed specifically for facial detection.\n\nOne of the most popular deep learning approaches is the Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network – or, MTCNN. This approach is popular because it achieved cutting-edge results (for the time) on a variety of benchmark datasets – plus, it is able to use landmark detection to recognize the eyes, mouth, and other facial features.\n\nMTCNN uses a cascade structure that contains three networks: P-net, R-Net, and O-Net. The image is first rescaled to different sizes (or an image period). P-Net proposes facial regions, R-Net filters the bounding boxes, and O-Net proposes facial landmarks.\n\n## WHY IS FACE DETECTION IMPORTANT TODAY?\n\nFace detection is the initial step in face analysis, face tracking, and, most importantly, face recognition. The latter industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and is applied to device unlocking, banking, hospitality, law enforcement, building security, and more. Face detection is necessary for facial recognition algorithms to know which parts of an image must be used to generate faceprints.\n\n## FACE DETECTION VS. FACE RECOGNITION: WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?\n\nFacial recognition is merely one application of face detection. The former is used for biometric verification and device unlocking, whereas the latter can also be applied to facial analysis and tracking. For a more comprehensive look at face recognition, check out our [Types of Biometrics guide.](https://recfaces.com/articles/types-of-biometrics)\n\n## ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF FACE DETECTION SYSTEMS\n\nWhile face detection systems can be powerful, they are by no means foolproof, as demonstrated by our list of challenges. Let’s take a look at the advantages and disadvantages that face detection systems can bring.\n\n### ADVANTAGES OF FACE DETECTION\n\n1. Better security. Face detection augments surveillance tactics and forms the basis of the identification process of terrorists and criminals;\n2. Easy to integrate. Most face detection solutions are compatible with security software;\n3. Automated identification. Face detection lets facial identification be automated, thus increasing efficiency alongside a heightened rate of accuracy.\n\n### DISADVANTAGES OF FACE DETECTION\n\n1. Huge storage requirements. Machine learning technology requires powerful data storage;\n2. Detection can be vulnerable. We’ve outlined the way in which facial detection can be thrown off;\n3. Potential privacy issues. There is disagreement on whether face detection is compatible with human privacy rights.\n\n### PROS AND CONS TABLE SUMMARY\n\n| Advantages of Face Detection | Disadvantages of Face Detection |\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| Better security              | Huge storage requirements       |\n| Easy to integrate            | Vulnerable detection            |\n| Automated identification     | Potential privacy issues        |\n\n## HOW FACE DETECTION ALGORITHMS ARE USED\n\nBefore we wrap up this guide, we wanted to give some examples of how face detection algorithms are applied in the real world. Some applications include photography, lip reading, marketing, and more.\n\n### FACIAL MOTION CAPTURE\n\nWith applications such as Snapchat, people’s faces can be altered in real-time with fun filters. Facial detection makes this possible, as its algorithms tell the applications that there is a face that can be traced and changed.\n\n### FACIAL RECOGNITION\n\n[Facial recognition](https://recfaces.com/articles/what-is-facial-recognition-used-for) adds increased security to nearly every global industry. It seeks to identify a person and then authenticate their identity – but for a person’s faceprint to be analyzed via facial recognition, the facial area to be assessed is determined by face detection.\n\n### PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nFacial recognition can be used to “tag” people’s faces in photos across social media platforms, and facial detection forms the foundation of this application. Furthermore, facial detection technology can be used alongside tracking to focus on a person’s face while the photo is being taken.\n\n### MARKETING\n\nFacial surveillance can help stores determine customers that have visited a few times and offer them perks or discounts – thus fostering increased customer loyalty.\n\n### EMOTIONAL INFERENCE\n\nEmotion recognition applications are still in the works; when they are fully developed, AI might be able to “read” nonverbal cues, gestures, body movements, and facial expressions to convey a person’s feelings.\n\n### LIP READING\n\nThe detection, modeling, and tracking of lips during videos can be used to generate automatic subtitles. Such an application can be found on YouTube, where some videos have the option to turn on subtitles, even if the creator has not provided any.\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nTo sum up the key points of this guide:\n\n* Face detection is AI-based computer technology that is used to extract and identify human faces from\n  digital images;\n* Face detection algorithms can be feature-based, knowledge-based, template matching, appearance- based, or a combination of methods;\n* Advantages of face detection include better security, easy integration, and automated identification;\n* Disadvantages include huge storage requirements, vulnerable detection, and potential privacy issues.\n\nFace detection is the foundation of a huge number of facial applications – we can see it in our day-to-day life. When we unlock our smartphone via face recognition, that would not be possible without face detection. The same goes for facial recognition surveillance systems, photo tagging, and Snapchat filters. There are many exciting applications in the works that we can thank face detection for!\n\n## Tutorial Time\n\nNow we will see a small example of OpenCV and Python with its explanations, before we start we will need following software and if you are Linux base OS then you can skip installation process. Lets start.\n\n### Installation on Windows\n\nSoftware we will be using\n\n1. PyCharm Community version\n2. Latest version of python\n3. And most import is your support. Lets start.\n\n#### 1. PyCharm Community version\n\nFirst open your favorite browser and paste this link in there `https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/` after that click on download under Community section.\n\n![PyCharm](/images/posts/pycharm.png)\n\nAfter downloading it just open the installer you shall be granted with this screen\n\n![PyCharm Community](/images/posts/pycharm-community.png)\n\nClick on next and complete installation process.\n\n#### 2. Python\n\nAfter completing installation of `PyCharm` now we will install Python, so same copy and past this link `https://www.python.org/downloads/` in browser and download installer\n\n![Python](/images/posts/python-download.png)\n\nNow open the installer and start the installation process and make sure that you check all the options in `Optional Features` like this\n\n![Python Optional Feature](/images/posts/python-optional-features.png)\n\nNow we are set for tutorial so open up your PyCharm.\n\n### Coding\n\nFirst of all we will be opening PyCharm from start menu under JetBrains folder\n\n![JetBrains](/images/posts/jetbrains.png)\n\nCreate a new project named it OpenCV.\n\n![pycharm64_sdEaNyoXbp](/images/posts/pycharm64_sdEaNyoXbp.png)\n\nAfter creating new project it will take few minutes to setup editor for us and after completing this will on your screen \n\n![PyCharm Editor](/images/posts/pycharm64_c6nRLL7MiL.png)\n\n#### Package Installation\n\nNow clear everything in `main.py` and it should be empty after that we will be creating a text file called `requirement.txt` in your project folder using `cmd` for that you have to open `cmd`and navigate to you project folder like this\n\n![CMD](/images/posts/cmd_CnLDIMeHY8.png)\n\nnow type `notepad.exe requirement.txt` it will ask you for create a new file and click on yes after that paste bellow packages name there.\n\n```text\nopencv-python\nopencv-contrib-python\nnumpy\npillow\n```\n\nSave the file and close it now as we have saved the file we need to install all this packages by bellow command it will take a few minutes depending on your data transfer speed\n\n```cmd\npip install -r requirement.txt\n```\n\nI have already installed it so it will give me this output\n\n![Package installation](/images/posts/cmd_J3z721ij7x.png)\n\n#### Video detection\n\n\nClose cmd and come back to your PyCharm, after we have installed all the required packages we will make a simple program for video capture so that we know that our video camera is working or not, but before we code in PyCharm we have to import all this packages we installed so follow me. First got to menu then File > Settings and you will see this window.\n\n![Project Settings](/images/posts/pycharm64_PxPA5214bM.png)\n\nOpen `Project: OpenCV` and in that select `Python Interpreter` in that add all this packages\n\n![Project Settings](/images/posts/pycharm64_PxPA5214bM.png)\n\nNow we will be coding a small program on video detection.\n\n```python\nimport cv2 #importing opencv package\ncapture = cv2.VideoCapture(0) # we will create a variable name capture to capture webcam of our device which is \"0\" or else you can write ip address in '' of your webcam\n\nwhile(True):\n    ret, frame = capture.read() # to read data from video capture variable\n    cv2.imshow(\"Video Feed\",frame) # to show live video camera feed\n    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'): # we have set waitKey at 0 means infinite or you can write any miliseconds and for ord('q') for quiting in live feed by pressing q on keyboard\n        break\n\ncapture.release()\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\nNow press <kbd>shift + F10</kbd> from keyboard or go-to menu Run > Run 'main' to run the program you may be able to see a new window with the name `Video Feed` try it yourself and you will be able to see your face. \n\n![Test image](/images/posts/vLylUVtgbB.png)This is test image which I will be using it.\n\n#### OpenCV Cascade\n\nIt means that our camera of our system is working properly now we need face detection cascades there are two ways of finding that files first is by downloading from [here](/files/cascades.zip) or by following commands open your cmd and type `python` or `py` after that type following commands\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nprint(cv2.__file__)\n```\n\n![CV2 Path](/images/posts/WindowsTerminal_vDoEGwj6gk.png)\n\nGo to the highlighted path and in there you will be able to see all the files and in that file there will be a folder called data will be there\n\n![Data](/images/posts/explorer_Ixdq0hGTPD.png)\n\nCopy that folder and past it in your project and rename from `data` to `cascade` like this.\n\n![Cascade](/images/posts/explorer_sCfK1JWEKV.png)\n\nAfter doing we will be creating a new variable called `face_cascade` and in that variable we will use OpenCV, paste this code in your main.py file\n\n```python\nimport cv2 #add bellow this line\nface_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml') \n```\n\n#### Using Face Classifier\n\nNow we will be converting our colored BGR color to Gray color so that our cascade can understand the image properly, mostly face detection works in gray scale so we will be converting our colored frame to gray scale. For that you have to create a new variable called gray under `ret, frame = capture.read()`. Remember OpenCV uses BGR method while for other color code it is RGB you must be familiar with RGB so you will understand BGR. Now we will add this line into our code \n\n```python\nret, frame = capture.read() # add bellow this line\ngray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # to convert BGR image to grayscale image\n```\n\n and don't worry if your not able to understand the code I will be giving you project like so that you can download it and run it on your own. We will now detect faces in webcam, photo frame or video. For that we will be using gray scale which we have converted from BGR ti GRAY so for that we need `detectMultiScale` function for scale factor and minimum neighbors detection.\n\n```python\ngray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) #add bellow this\nfaces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.5, minNeighbors=5) # you can play with the numbers as much as you want\n```\n\nnow we will pe finding our face in frame by finding position and checking whether the face is present or not for that we will be using width, height, x direction, y direction of the video feed.\n\n```python\nfaces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.5, minNeighbors=5)  # add bellow this line\n    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:\n        print(x,y,w,h) # print coordinates of your face\n```\n\nThis command will show you the coordinates of your face in the frame so that we can identify that someone is present here.\n\n![Face Coordinate's](/images/posts/9GZxLCVtAp.png)\n\nNow we will be drawing a square around our face so that we can clearly identify it for that we will be will be using gray scale image. Now we will make a region of interest or ROI using gray scale image to determine its width and height\n\n```python\n   for (x, y, w, h) in faces:\n        print(x,y,w,h) # print bellow this line\n        roi_gray = gray[y:y + h, x:x + h] # regoin of interest of gray scale image\n        roi_color = frame[y:y + h, x:x + w] # regoin of interest of colored image\n```\n\nso now as we have found our region of interest we will check that whether it is working properly or not so we will capture our face by making a PNG fine\n\n```python\n\t\troi_color = frame[y:y + h, x:x + w] # add bellow this\n    \timg_item = \"my-image.png\" # creating a variable name img_item\n    \tcv2.imwrite(img_item, roi_color) # to create an image file where we can see our face only\n```\n\nWhat this above line will do is that it will create an PNG file with the name `my-image.png` in your project folder so that we can understand that which portion of our face is been captured.\n\n ![my-image.png](/images/posts/ATItkXEuFa.png)\n\nAfter detecting our face and saving it in a PNG file what we will do is that we will create a border and track our live feed cam and see it more clearly\n\n```python\n    \tcv2.imwrite(img_item, roi_color) # add bellow this\n    \tcolor = (0,0,255) # BGR format you can choose whatever you want go to this site to choose color https://wamingo.net/rgbbgr/\n        stroke = 2\n        end_cord_x = x + w\n        end_cord_y = y + h\n        cv2.rectangle(frame,(x, y), (end_cord_x, end_cord_y), color, stroke)\n```\n\n![Drawing rectangle on face](/images/posts/bzUl6UbhVI.png)\n\nUntil now what we have done is that we have just detecting our face using `Cascades` but as we have successfully done it so now we will be creating recognizer to recognize who is that person is for that we will be creating an algorithm. So now we will be creating new python file `train-faces.py` so that we will be writing all the algorithm in it to train our facial recognition system. After creating `train-faces.py` file we will create a folder of name `images` where we will be adding all images in it to train our trainer. Open train-faces.py and type the following code:\n\n```python\nimport os # to detect which kind of operating system we are been using example: Windows, Linux, Debian, Mac, etc.\nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) # to automatical find out the path of our project\n```\n\nWhat we have done is that we told the system to find the path of our project automatically and also to detect os also and after detecting our project folder we will be adding our images directory so that we will be able to find all images at one place.\n\n```python\nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) # add bellow this\nimage_dir = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, \"images\") # this will add images at the end of our base dir example: C:\\User\\Admin\\Desktop\\facedetection\\images\\\n```\n\nAs our system or file has detected the path we will check all the images which are present in it.\n\n```python\nimage_dir = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, \"images\") # add bellow this line\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(image_dir): # this will detect our image path\n    for file in files: \n        if file.endswith(\"png\") or file.endswith(\"jpg\"): # this is use to check whether there are png file or jpg files\n            path = os.path.join(root, file) # this will join our project director and images folder path\n            print(path) # to check all the apth of images\n```\n\n![Image path](/images/posts/pycharm64_QFG764uyci.png)\n\nNow what we will do is that we will be giving labels to our directories which are present in images folder \n\n```python\n            path = os.path.join(root, file) # add bellow this line\n    \t\tlabel = os.path.basename(root) # to give the label of our image folder\n        \tprint(label, path) # add label in old print function\n```\n\nSo when we will run the code now we will be able to see path as well as label. So now we will be creating empty list.\n\n```python\nimage_dir = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, \"images\") # add bellow this\ny_labels = []\nx_train = []\n```\n\nTraining images using `NumPy` array also we will be using `PIL` python library to grab pill of image\n\n```python\nimport cv2 #add bellow this\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\n```\n\nAfter importing Image from PIL library we will be converting image into gray\n\n```python\n        \tprint(label, path) # add bellow this\n    \t\tpil_image = Image.open(path).convert(\"L\") # to convert colored image to gray scale\n```\n\nNow we will be using NumPy array to train our images\n\n```\n    \t\tpil_image = Image.open(path).convert(\"L\") # add bellow this line\n    \t\timage_array = np.array(pil_image, \"uint8\")\n    \t\tprint(image_array) # to check images array\n```\n\n![Image Array](/images/posts/pycharm64_D0vgyFuYoF.png)\n\nWe will check ROI of images so that we can train our trainer for that we need to `import cv2` into our `train-faces.py` using our Cascades\n\n```python\nimport cv2 \nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) # to automatical find out the path of our project\n\nimage_dir = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, \"images\") # this will add images at the end of our base dir example: C:\\User\\Admin\\Desktop\\facedetection\\images\\\nface_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml') # add this line\n```\n\nAfter importing OpenCV and Cascades we will be detecting faces using `detectMultiScale`.\n\n```python\n            print(image_array) # add bellow this\n    \t\tfaces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(image_array, scaleFactor=1.5, minNeighbors=5)\n            for (x, y, w, h) in faces:\n                roi = image_array[y:y + h, x:x + w]\n                x_train.append(roi)\n```\n\nWe will be giving labels so that it would be easy to understand it properly, also not that it would be easy to see who is the person in the video feed or photo frame for that we will be creating a variable.\n\n```python\nface_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml') # add bellow this line\ncurrent_id = 0 # creating an id starting with 0\nlabel_ids = {} # to create and empty directory\n# Now come down to this line \n        \tprint(label, path) # ad bellow this\n            if not label in label_ids: # it will check whether the labels are there or not\n                label_ids[label] = current_id\n                current_id += 1\n            id_ = label_ids[label]\n            print(label_ids) # to print label ids\n# Now come down to this line \n\t\t\t\tx_train.append(roi) # add bellow this line\n                y_labels.append(id_)\nprint(y_labels)\nprint(x_train)\n```\n\nWhat we have done is that we have created labels ids for each and every image we have so after doing that we will saving all thoes lables so that it would be easy for our program to recognize it for that we need pickle so I assume that you know who to import any library so import pickle. Now go to the bottom of you train-faces.py file and paste bellow code but before pasting this code make sure to add `#` infront of `print` function.\n\n```python\nwith open(\"labels.pickle\", \"wb\") as f:\n    pickle.dump(label_ids, f)\n```\n\nAfter this we will train our OpenCV recognizer for each an every images so that it can recognize it propely so for that we will create a variable call recognizer.\n\n```python\nface_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml') # add bellow this line\nrecognizer = cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create() #creating our face recognizer\n```\n\nSuccessful creation of our recognizer we will be needing numpy array to save all those array in a single file and remember one thing the more numbers of photo will take more time to write it also it deppends on speed of your devices also.\n\n```python\nwith open(\"labels.pickle\", \"wb\") as f:\n    pickle.dump(label_ids, f) # add bellow this\nrecognizer.train(x_train, np.array(y_labels)) # using numpy array we will be training our recognizer\nrecognizer.save(\"trainer.yml\") # and from above training we will be saving it in a single file called trainner.yml\n```\n\n\nAs we have completed our `train-faces.py` we will run it and train our project so that we can recognize our faces, so now go to your cmd and `type py tain-faces.py` and wait until you get this message\n\n```\nProcess finished with exit code 0\n```\n\nAfter you see this message it means that our trainer has been successfully trained so main.py is been left to update for final run. Now open your main.py file and past this line\n\n```python\nface_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml') # add bellow this\nrecognizer = cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create() #creating our face recognizer\nrecongnizer.read(\"trainer.yml\")\nwith open(\"labels.pickle\", \"rb\") as f:\n    og_labels = pickle.load(f)\n```\n\nWhat we did is imported `trainer.yml` so that we can read all the data we have been trained data. After that we will be import all the the tags and ids we have created.\n\n```python\n        roi_color = img[y:y + h, x:x + w] # add bellow this line\n        id_, conf = recognizer.predict(roi_gray)\n\t\t        if conf>= 45:\n            print(id_)\n```\n\n#### Loading Label Names from Pickle\n\nNow we will labels from `labels.pickle` so that we can identify labels, so what we will do is fetch all the labels from that file.\n\n```\nrecognizer.read(\"trainer.yml\") # add bellow this\n\nlabels = {\"person_name\": 1} # display person name\n```\n\nWhat we did is we will display person name so to do that we are going to add this line to display it\n\n```python\n    og_labels = pickle.load(f) # add bellow this\n    labels = {v:k for k,v in labels.items()}\n```\n\nNow we will print ids\n\n```python\n            print(id_) # add bellow this\n    \n```\n\n#### Put Text on your face\n\nWe will put text on our webcam face recognition so that we can identify who is that person is for that we will be using `putText` function.\n\n```python\n        if conf >= 45:\n            print(id_)\n            print(labels[id_]) # add bellow this\n            font = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX\n            name = labels[id_]\n            color = (0,0,255) # BGR choose any color you like\n```\n\nWe will resize little bit so that it reads perfectly in `train-faces.py`\n\n```python\n            pil_image = Image.open(path).convert(\"L\") # add bellow this\n\t\t\tsize = (500,500)\n            final_image = pil_image.rezise(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)\n```\n\nAfter saving both the files run your main.py file and check the output of it.\n\n#### Complete Code\n\n**requirement.txt**\n\n```text\nopencv-python\nopencv-contrib-python\nnumpy\npillow\n```\n\n**main.py**\n\n```python\nimport cv2 \nimport pickle\n# url = '' #

Face detection\n  also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to\n  faces in a visual scene.\ncover: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t-MDoI7MuY0/maxresdefault.jpg\ntags:\n  - technology\n  - industrial automation\n  - ubuntu\n  - information\n  - robotics\ncategories:\n  - Industrial automation\n  - Simulation\n  - technology\n  - Windows\nseries:\n  - World\n---\n![Face Detection](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t-MDoI7MuY0/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\n## What is Face Detection?\n\nFace detection is AI-based computer technology that is used to extract and identify human faces from digital images. When integrated with [biometric](https://recfaces.com/articles/what-is-biometrics) security systems (particularly, facial recognition ones), this kind of technology is what makes it possible to monitor and track people in real-time. In applications that use facial tracking, analysis, and recognition, face detection typically works as the first step and has a significant impact on how sequential operations within the app will perform.\n\nFace detection helps with facial analysis by identifying the parts of a video or an image that should be focused on when determining gender, age, and emotions. Similarly, with facial recognition systems (which create “faceprint” maps of facial features), face detection data is included in the system’s algorithms. And why? Face detection helps determine which parts of the video or image are needed to produce a faceprint.\n\n## HOW DOES FACE DETECTION WORK?\n\nFace detection technology uses machine learning and algorithms in order to extract human faces from larger images; such images typically contain plenty of non-face objects, such as buildings, landscapes, and various body parts.\n\nFacial detection algorithms usually begin by seeking out human eyes, which are one of the easiest facial features to detect. Next, the algorithm might try to find the mouth, nose, eyebrows, and iris. After identifying these facial features, and the algorithm concludes that it has extracted a face, it then goes through additional tests to confirm that it is, indeed, a face.\n\nTo make algorithms as accurate as possible, they must be trained with huge data sets that contain hundreds of thousands of images. Some of these images contain faces, while others do not. The training procedures help the algorithm’s ability to decide whether an image contains faces, and where those facial regions are located.\n\nAlso, now would be a good time to give you definitions of the main types of algorithms – ML, AI, and Deep Learning.\n\n* **Machine Learning (ML)**: ML algorithms use statistics to find patterns in huge amounts of data. This data can include words, numbers, images, clicks, and more. ML is the process behind many modern services – voice assistants (Siri and Alexa), search engines (Google and Baidu), and recommendation systems (Spotify and Netflix);\n* **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: If an ML solution is programmed to learn how to perform a task, rather than just simple performance, then it is AI. Systems that use AI demonstrate behaviors similar to human intelligence – for instance, problem solving, planning, learning, perception, manipulation, and reasoning;\n* **Deep Learning:** This algorithm is a subset of machine learning, and it is what forms deep neural networks; essentially, machines are given a greater ability to find and amplify tiny patterns. Such networks have any layers of computational nodes that collaborate to sift through data and deliver predictions.\n\nNow, as for the exact technologies used to develop face detection applications; these include:\n\n* OpenCV;\n* Matlab;\n* Tensorflow;\n* Neural Networks.\n\nAll of these follow almost the exact same procedure for face detection.\n\n### FACE DETECTION METHODS\n\nThree researchers from the University of California, David Kriegman, Ming-Hsuan Yang, and Narendra Ahuja, published a classification of facial detection methods. There are four classifiable categories, of which face detection algorithms can belong to 2+ groups. Let’s take a look at each category.\n\n#### Feature-Based Method\n\nThis method located faces by extracting structural features. First, an algorithm is trained as a classifier. Next, it is used to sort facial regions from non-facial regions. The general idea is to move past humans’ instinctive knowledge of faces. When feature-based approaches tackle photos with many faces, they have a 94% success rate.\n\n**Summary:** Features such as a person’s nose or eyes are used to detect a face.\n\n#### Knowledge-Based Method\n\nA knowledge-based algorithm is dependent upon a set of rules, and it is built on human knowledge. For instance, “rules” might include that a face should have eyes, a nose, and a mouth in certain positions relative to each other. However, this kind of method comes with one huge challenge: it is very difficult to build an appropriate rules set. If the rules are too general, there may be many false positives – and, conversely, if the rules are too detailed, the system could generate many false negatives.\n\n**Summary:** A face is determined based on whether it meets a set of rules made by a human.\n\n#### Template Matching Method\n\nWith a template matching algorithm, parameterized or pre-defined templates are used to locate or detect faces – the system measures the correlation between the input photos and the templates. For instance, the template may show that a human face is divided into nose, mouth, eyes, and face contour regions. Also, a facial model could be comprised of just edges and use the edge detection method – implementation of this approach is easy, but it is insufficient for face detection.\n\n**Summary:** Images are compared to standard face patterns that have been previously stored.\n\n#### Appearance-Based Method\n\nAn appearance-based algorithm uses a set of training images to “learn” what a face should look like. In general, this method relies on machine learning and statistical analysis to determine relevant facial characteristics. An appearance-based approach is generally considered to be stronger than the previously mentioned methods.\n\n**Summary:** Statistical analysis and machine learning are combined to find a face image’s characteristics.\n\n### FACE DETECTION TECHNIQUES\n\nSome of the more specific facial detection techniques include:\n\n1. Removing the background. Let’s say an image has a pre-defined, static background or a plain, single-color background – removing it can help determine the face’s boundaries;\n2. With color images, the color of the skin can sometimes be used to find faces;\n3. Motion can be used to detect faces. In a real-time video, a person’s face is nearly always in motion. However, a drawback of this technique is that a face could be confused with other moving objects.\n\nWhen the aforementioned strategies are combined, they can create a comprehensive face detection approach.\n\n## WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES IN FACE DETECTION?\n\nResearchers Ashu Kumar, Amandeep Kaur, and Munish Kumar published a [review of face detection techniques](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326667118_Face_Detection_Techniques_A_Review), which included a detailed explanation of the challenges that facial detection faces. To sum up their findings, the challenges in face detection include:\n\n* Odd expressions. A human face might have an odd expression, making it difficult for facial detection algorithms to identify it as a face;\n* Face occlusion. If a face is hidden by hair, a hat, a hand, glasses, or a scarf, it may result in a false negative;\n* Illuminations. An image might not have uniform lighting effects; part of the image may be overexposed, while another part is very dark. Again, this can contribute to false negatives;\n* Complex background. When lots of objects are present in an image, face detection’s accuracy is reduced;\n* Too many faces. If there is a large number of human faces in an image, face detection software may have a hard time distinguishing between some of them;\n* Low resolution. If an image’s resolution is poor, it is more difficult to detect faces;\n* Skin color. If somebody’s skin color falls outside of the gradient that is recognized by the algorithm,\n  their face might not be detected.\n\n## HOW DOES FACE DETECTION WORK WITH DEEP LEARNING?\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, deep learning is a subset of machine learning in which large neural networks process huge amounts of data and make complex predictions. So how does deep learning factor into face detection? Well, multiple [deep learning methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02766) have been developed specifically for facial detection.\n\nOne of the most popular deep learning approaches is the Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network – or, MTCNN. This approach is popular because it achieved cutting-edge results (for the time) on a variety of benchmark datasets – plus, it is able to use landmark detection to recognize the eyes, mouth, and other facial features.\n\nMTCNN uses a cascade structure that contains three networks: P-net, R-Net, and O-Net. The image is first rescaled to different sizes (or an image period). P-Net proposes facial regions, R-Net filters the bounding boxes, and O-Net proposes facial landmarks.\n\n## WHY IS FACE DETECTION IMPORTANT TODAY?\n\nFace detection is the initial step in face analysis, face tracking, and, most importantly, face recognition. The latter industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and is applied to device unlocking, banking, hospitality, law enforcement, building security, and more. Face detection is necessary for facial recognition algorithms to know which parts of an image must be used to generate faceprints.\n\n## FACE DETECTION VS. FACE RECOGNITION: WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?\n\nFacial recognition is merely one application of face detection. The former is used for biometric verification and device unlocking, whereas the latter can also be applied to facial analysis and tracking. For a more comprehensive look at face recognition, check out our [Types of Biometrics guide.](https://recfaces.com/articles/types-of-biometrics)\n\n## ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF FACE DETECTION SYSTEMS\n\nWhile face detection systems can be powerful, they are by no means foolproof, as demonstrated by our list of challenges. Let’s take a look at the advantages and disadvantages that face detection systems can bring.\n\n### ADVANTAGES OF FACE DETECTION\n\n1. Better security. Face detection augments surveillance tactics and forms the basis of the identification process of terrorists and criminals;\n2. Easy to integrate. Most face detection solutions are compatible with security software;\n3. Automated identification. Face detection lets facial identification be automated, thus increasing efficiency alongside a heightened rate of accuracy.\n\n### DISADVANTAGES OF FACE DETECTION\n\n1. Huge storage requirements. Machine learning technology requires powerful data storage;\n2. Detection can be vulnerable. We’ve outlined the way in which facial detection can be thrown off;\n3. Potential privacy issues. There is disagreement on whether face detection is compatible with human privacy rights.\n\n### PROS AND CONS TABLE SUMMARY\n\n| Advantages of Face Detection | Disadvantages of Face Detection |\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| Better security              | Huge storage requirements       |\n| Easy to integrate            | Vulnerable detection            |\n| Automated identification     | Potential privacy issues        |\n\n## HOW FACE DETECTION ALGORITHMS ARE USED\n\nBefore we wrap up this guide, we wanted to give some examples of how face detection algorithms are applied in the real world. Some applications include photography, lip reading, marketing, and more.\n\n### FACIAL MOTION CAPTURE\n\nWith applications such as Snapchat, people’s faces can be altered in real-time with fun filters. Facial detection makes this possible, as its algorithms tell the applications that there is a face that can be traced and changed.\n\n### FACIAL RECOGNITION\n\n[Facial recognition](https://recfaces.com/articles/what-is-facial-recognition-used-for) adds increased security to nearly every global industry. It seeks to identify a person and then authenticate their identity – but for a person’s faceprint to be analyzed via facial recognition, the facial area to be assessed is determined by face detection.\n\n### PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nFacial recognition can be used to “tag” people’s faces in photos across social media platforms, and facial detection forms the foundation of this application. Furthermore, facial detection technology can be used alongside tracking to focus on a person’s face while the photo is being taken.\n\n### MARKETING\n\nFacial surveillance can help stores determine customers that have visited a few times and offer them perks or discounts – thus fostering increased customer loyalty.\n\n### EMOTIONAL INFERENCE\n\nEmotion recognition applications are still in the works; when they are fully developed, AI might be able to “read” nonverbal cues, gestures, body movements, and facial expressions to convey a person’s feelings.\n\n### LIP READING\n\nThe detection, modeling, and tracking of lips during videos can be used to generate automatic subtitles. Such an application can be found on YouTube, where some videos have the option to turn on subtitles, even if the creator has not provided any.\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nTo sum up the key points of this guide:\n\n* Face detection is AI-based computer technology that is used to extract and identify human faces from\n  digital images;\n* Face detection algorithms can be feature-based, knowledge-based, template matching, appearance- based, or a combination of methods;\n* Advantages of face detection include better security, easy integration, and automated identification;\n* Disadvantages include huge storage requirements, vulnerable detection, and potential privacy issues.\n\nFace detection is the foundation of a huge number of facial applications – we can see it in our day-to-day life. When we unlock our smartphone via face recognition, that would not be possible without face detection. The same goes for facial recognition surveillance systems, photo tagging, and Snapchat filters. There are many exciting applications in the works that we can thank face detection for!\n\n## Tutorial Time\n\nNow we will see a small example of OpenCV and Python with its explanations, before we start we will need following software and if you are Linux base OS then you can skip installation process. Lets start.\n\n### Installation on Windows\n\nSoftware we will be using\n\n1. PyCharm Community version\n2. Latest version of python\n3. And most import is your support. Lets start.\n\n#### 1. PyCharm Community version\n\nFirst open your favorite browser and paste this link in there `https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/` after that click on download under Community section.\n\n![PyCharm](/images/posts/pycharm.png)\n\nAfter downloading it just open the installer you shall be granted with this screen\n\n![PyCharm Community](/images/posts/pycharm-community.png)\n\nClick on next and complete installation process.\n\n#### 2. Python\n\nAfter completing installation of `PyCharm` now we will install Python, so same copy and past this link `https://www.python.org/downloads/` in browser and download installer\n\n![Python](/images/posts/python-download.png)\n\nNow open the installer and start the installation process and make sure that you check all the options in `Optional Features` like this\n\n![Python Optional Feature](/images/posts/python-optional-features.png)\n\nNow we are set for tutorial so open up your PyCharm.\n\n### Coding\n\nFirst of all we will be opening PyCharm from start menu under JetBrains folder\n\n![JetBrains](/images/posts/jetbrains.png)\n\nCreate a new project named it OpenCV.\n\n![pycharm64_sdEaNyoXbp](/images/posts/pycharm64_sdEaNyoXbp.png)\n\nAfter creating new project it will take few minutes to setup editor for us and after completing this will on your screen \n\n![PyCharm Editor](/images/posts/pycharm64_c6nRLL7MiL.png)\n\n#### Package Installation\n\nNow clear everything in `main.py` and it should be empty after that we will be creating a text file called `requirement.txt` in your project folder using `cmd` for that you have to open `cmd`and navigate to you project folder like this\n\n![CMD](/images/posts/cmd_CnLDIMeHY8.png)\n\nnow type `notepad.exe requirement.txt` it will ask you for create a new file and click on yes after that paste bellow packages name there.\n\n```text\nopencv-python\nopencv-contrib-python\nnumpy\npillow\n```\n\nSave the file and close it now as we have saved the file we need to install all this packages by bellow command it will take a few minutes depending on your data transfer speed\n\n```cmd\npip install -r requirement.txt\n```\n\nI have already installed it so it will give me this output\n\n![Package installation](/images/posts/cmd_J3z721ij7x.png)\n\n#### Video detection\n\n\nClose cmd and come back to your PyCharm, after we have installed all the required packages we will make a simple program for video capture so that we know that our video camera is working or not, but before we code in PyCharm we have to import all this packages we installed so follow me. First got to menu then File > Settings and you will see this window.\n\n![Project Settings](/images/posts/pycharm64_PxPA5214bM.png)\n\nOpen `Project: OpenCV` and in that select `Python Interpreter` in that add all this packages\n\n![Project Settings](/images/posts/pycharm64_PxPA5214bM.png)\n\nNow we will be coding a small program on video detection.\n\n```python\nimport cv2 #importing opencv package\ncapture = cv2.VideoCapture(0) # we will create a variable name capture to capture webcam of our device which is \"0\" or else you can write ip address in '' of your webcam\n\nwhile(True):\n    ret, frame = capture.read() # to read data from video capture variable\n    cv2.imshow(\"Video Feed\",frame) # to show live video camera feed\n    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'): # we have set waitKey at 0 means infinite or you can write any miliseconds and for ord('q') for quiting in live feed by pressing q on keyboard\n        break\n\ncapture.release()\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\nNow press <kbd>shift + F10</kbd> from keyboard or go-to menu Run > Run 'main' to run the program you may be able to see a new window with the name `Video Feed` try it yourself and you will be able to see your face. \n\n![Test image](/images/posts/vLylUVtgbB.png)This is test image which I will be using it.\n\n#### OpenCV Cascade\n\nIt means that our camera of our system is working properly now we need face detection cascades there are two ways of finding that files first is by downloading from [here](/files/cascades.zip) or by following commands open your cmd and type `python` or `py` after that type following commands\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nprint(cv2.__file__)\n```\n\n![CV2 Path](/images/posts/WindowsTerminal_vDoEGwj6gk.png)\n\nGo to the highlighted path and in there you will be able to see all the files and in that file there will be a folder called data will be there\n\n![Data](/images/posts/explorer_Ixdq0hGTPD.png)\n\nCopy that folder and past it in your project and rename from `data` to `cascade` like this.\n\n![Cascade](/images/posts/explorer_sCfK1JWEKV.png)\n\nAfter doing we will be creating a new variable called `face_cascade` and in that variable we will use OpenCV, paste this code in your main.py file\n\n```python\nimport cv2 #add bellow this line\nface_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml') \n```\n\n#### Using Face Classifier\n\nNow we will be converting our colored BGR color to Gray color so that our cascade can understand the image properly, mostly face detection works in gray scale so we will be converting our colored frame to gray scale. For that you have to create a new variable called gray under `ret, frame = capture.read()`. Remember OpenCV uses BGR method while for other color code it is RGB you must be familiar with RGB so you will understand BGR. Now we will add this line into our code \n\n```python\nret, frame = capture.read() # add bellow this line\ngray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # to convert BGR image to grayscale image\n```\n\n and don't worry if your not able to understand the code I will be giving you project like so that you can download it and run it on your own. We will now detect faces in webcam, photo frame or video. For that we will be using gray scale which we have converted from BGR ti GRAY so for that we need `detectMultiScale` function for scale factor and minimum neighbors detection.\n\n```python\ngray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) #add bellow this\nfaces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.5, minNeighbors=5) # you can play with the numbers as much as you want\n```\n\nnow we will pe finding our face in frame by finding position and checking whether the face is present or not for that we will be using width, height, x direction, y direction of the video feed.\n\n```python\nfaces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.5, minNeighbors=5)  # add bellow this line\n    for (x, y, w, h) in faces:\n        print(x,y,w,h) # print coordinates of your face\n```\n\nThis command will show you the coordinates of your face in the frame so that we can identify that someone is present here.\n\n![Face Coordinate's](/images/posts/9GZxLCVtAp.png)\n\nNow we will be drawing a square around our face so that we can clearly identify it for that we will be will be using gray scale image. Now we will make a region of interest or ROI using gray scale image to determine its width and height\n\n```python\n   for (x, y, w, h) in faces:\n        print(x,y,w,h) # print bellow this line\n        roi_gray = gray[y:y + h, x:x + h] # regoin of interest of gray scale image\n        roi_color = frame[y:y + h, x:x + w] # regoin of interest of colored image\n```\n\nso now as we have found our region of interest we will check that whether it is working properly or not so we will capture our face by making a PNG fine\n\n```python\n\t\troi_color = frame[y:y + h, x:x + w] # add bellow this\n    \timg_item = \"my-image.png\" # creating a variable name img_item\n    \tcv2.imwrite(img_item, roi_color) # to create an image file where we can see our face only\n```\n\nWhat this above line will do is that it will create an PNG file with the name `my-image.png` in your project folder so that we can understand that which portion of our face is been captured.\n\n ![my-image.png](/images/posts/ATItkXEuFa.png)\n\nAfter detecting our face and saving it in a PNG file what we will do is that we will create a border and track our live feed cam and see it more clearly\n\n```python\n    \tcv2.imwrite(img_item, roi_color) # add bellow this\n    \tcolor = (0,0,255) # BGR format you can choose whatever you want go to this site to choose color https://wamingo.net/rgbbgr/\n        stroke = 2\n        end_cord_x = x + w\n        end_cord_y = y + h\n        cv2.rectangle(frame,(x, y), (end_cord_x, end_cord_y), color, stroke)\n```\n\n![Drawing rectangle on face](/images/posts/bzUl6UbhVI.png)\n\nUntil now what we have done is that we have just detecting our face using `Cascades` but as we have successfully done it so now we will be creating recognizer to recognize who is that person is for that we will be creating an algorithm. So now we will be creating new python file `train-faces.py` so that we will be writing all the algorithm in it to train our facial recognition system. After creating `train-faces.py` file we will create a folder of name `images` where we will be adding all images in it to train our trainer. Open train-faces.py and type the following code:\n\n```python\nimport os # to detect which kind of operating system we are been using example: Windows, Linux, Debian, Mac, etc.\nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) # to automatical find out the path of our project\n```\n\nWhat we have done is that we told the system to find the path of our project automatically and also to detect os also and after detecting our project folder we will be adding our images directory so that we will be able to find all images at one place.\n\n```python\nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) # add bellow this\nimage_dir = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, \"images\") # this will add images at the end of our base dir example: C:\\User\\Admin\\Desktop\\facedetection\\images\\\n```\n\nAs our system or file has detected the path we will check all the images which are present in it.\n\n```python\nimage_dir = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, \"images\") # add bellow this line\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(image_dir): # this will detect our image path\n    for file in files: \n        if file.endswith(\"png\") or file.endswith(\"jpg\"): # this is use to check whether there are png file or jpg files\n            path = os.path.join(root, file) # this will join our project director and images folder path\n            print(path) # to check all the apth of images\n```\n\n![Image path](/images/posts/pycharm64_QFG764uyci.png)\n\nNow what we will do is that we will be giving labels to our directories which are present in images folder \n\n```python\n            path = os.path.join(root, file) # add bellow this line\n    \t\tlabel = os.path.basename(root) # to give the label of our image folder\n        \tprint(label, path) # add label in old print function\n```\n\nSo when we will run the code now we will be able to see path as well as label. So now we will be creating empty list.\n\n```python\nimage_dir = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, \"images\") # add bellow this\ny_labels = []\nx_train = []\n```\n\nTraining images using `NumPy` array also we will be using `PIL` python library to grab pill of image\n\n```python\nimport cv2 #add bellow this\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\n```\n\nAfter importing Image from PIL library we will be converting image into gray\n\n```python\n        \tprint(label, path) # add bellow this\n    \t\tpil_image = Image.open(path).convert(\"L\") # to convert colored image to gray scale\n```\n\nNow we will be using NumPy array to train our images\n\n```\n    \t\tpil_image = Image.open(path).convert(\"L\") # add bellow this line\n    \t\timage_array = np.array(pil_image, \"uint8\")\n    \t\tprint(image_array) # to check images array\n```\n\n![Image Array](/images/posts/pycharm64_D0vgyFuYoF.png)\n\nWe will check ROI of images so that we can train our trainer for that we need to `import cv2` into our `train-faces.py` using our Cascades\n\n```python\nimport cv2 \nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) # to automatical find out the path of our project\n\nimage_dir = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, \"images\") # this will add images at the end of our base dir example: C:\\User\\Admin\\Desktop\\facedetection\\images\\\nface_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml') # add this line\n```\n\nAfter importing OpenCV and Cascades we will be detecting faces using `detectMultiScale`.\n\n```python\n            print(image_array) # add bellow this\n    \t\tfaces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(image_array, scaleFactor=1.5, minNeighbors=5)\n            for (x, y, w, h) in faces:\n                roi = image_array[y:y + h, x:x + w]\n                x_train.append(roi)\n```\n\nWe will be giving labels so that it would be easy to understand it properly, also not that it would be easy to see who is the person in the video feed or photo frame for that we will be creating a variable.\n\n```python\nface_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml') # add bellow this line\ncurrent_id = 0 # creating an id starting with 0\nlabel_ids = {} # to create and empty directory\n# Now come down to this line \n        \tprint(label, path) # ad bellow this\n            if not label in label_ids: # it will check whether the labels are there or not\n                label_ids[label] = current_id\n                current_id += 1\n            id_ = label_ids[label]\n            print(label_ids) # to print label ids\n# Now come down to this line \n\t\t\t\tx_train.append(roi) # add bellow this line\n                y_labels.append(id_)\nprint(y_labels)\nprint(x_train)\n```\n\nWhat we have done is that we have created labels ids for each and every image we have so after doing that we will saving all thoes lables so that it would be easy for our program to recognize it for that we need pickle so I assume that you know who to import any library so import pickle. Now go to the bottom of you train-faces.py file and paste bellow code but before pasting this code make sure to add `#` infront of `print` function.\n\n```python\nwith open(\"labels.pickle\", \"wb\") as f:\n    pickle.dump(label_ids, f)\n```\n\nAfter this we will train our OpenCV recognizer for each an every images so that it can recognize it propely so for that we will create a variable call recognizer.\n\n```python\nface_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml') # add bellow this line\nrecognizer = cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create() #creating our face recognizer\n```\n\nSuccessful creation of our recognizer we will be needing numpy array to save all those array in a single file and remember one thing the more numbers of photo will take more time to write it also it deppends on speed of your devices also.\n\n```python\nwith open(\"labels.pickle\", \"wb\") as f:\n    pickle.dump(label_ids, f) # add bellow this\nrecognizer.train(x_train, np.array(y_labels)) # using numpy array we will be training our recognizer\nrecognizer.save(\"trainer.yml\") # and from above training we will be saving it in a single file called trainner.yml\n```\n\n\nAs we have completed our `train-faces.py` we will run it and train our project so that we can recognize our faces, so now go to your cmd and `type py tain-faces.py` and wait until you get this message\n\n```\nProcess finished with exit code 0\n```\n\nAfter you see this message it means that our trainer has been successfully trained so main.py is been left to update for final run. Now open your main.py file and past this line\n\n```python\nface_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('cascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml') # add bellow this\nrecognizer = cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create() #creating our face recognizer\nrecongnizer.read(\"trainer.yml\")\nwith open(\"labels.pickle\", \"rb\") as f:\n    og_labels = pickle.load(f)\n```\n\nWhat we did is imported `trainer.yml` so that we can read all the data we have been trained data. After that we will be import all the the tags and ids we have created.\n\n```python\n        roi_color = img[y:y + h, x:x + w] # add bellow this line\n        id_, conf = recognizer.predict(roi_gray)\n\t\t        if conf>= 45:\n            print(id_)\n```\n\n#### Loading Label Names from Pickle\n\nNow we will labels from `labels.pickle` so that we can identify labels, so what we will do is fetch all the labels from that file.\n\n```\nrecognizer.read(\"trainer.yml\") # add bellow this\n\nlabels = {\"person_name\": 1} # display person name\n```\n\nWhat we did is we will display person name so to do that we are going to add this line to display it\n\n```python\n    og_labels = pickle.load(f) # add bellow this\n    labels = {v:k for k,v in labels.items()}\n```\n\nNow we will print ids\n\n```python\n            print(id_) # add bellow this\n    \n```\n\n#### Put Text on your face\n\nWe will put text on our webcam face recognition so that we can identify who is that person is for that we will be using `putText` function.\n\n```python\n        if conf >= 45:\n            print(id_)\n            print(labels[id_]) # add bellow this\n            font = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX\n            name = labels[id_]\n            color = (0,0,255) # BGR choose any color you like\n```\n\nWe will resize little bit so that it reads perfectly in `train-faces.py`\n\n```python\n            pil_image = Image.open(path).convert(\"L\") # add bellow this\n\t\t\tsize = (500,500)\n            final_image = pil_image.rezise(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)\n```\n\nAfter saving both the files run your main.py file and check the output of it.\n\n#### Complete Code\n\n**requirement.txt**\n\n```text\nopencv-python\nopencv-contrib-python\nnumpy\npillow\n```\n\n**main.py**\n\n```python\nimport cv2 \nimport pickle\n# url = '' #

When integrated with <a href=\"https://recfaces.com/articles/what-is-biometrics\">biometric</a> security systems (particularly, facial recognition ones), this kind of technology is what makes it possible to monitor and track people in real-time. In applications that use facial tracking, analysis, and recognition, face detection typically works as the first step and has a significant impact on how sequential operations within the app will perform.</p>\n<p>Face detection helps with facial analysis by identifying the parts of a video or an image that should be focused on when determining gender, age, and emotions. Similarly, with facial recognition systems (which create “faceprint” maps of facial features), face detection data is included in the system’s algorithms. And why? Face detection helps determine which parts of the video or image are needed to produce a faceprint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"HOW-DOES-FACE-DETECTION-WORK\"><a href=\"#HOW-DOES-FACE-DETECTION-WORK\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"HOW DOES FACE DETECTION WORK?\"></a>HOW DOES FACE DETECTION WORK?</h2><p>Face detection technology uses machine learning and algorithms in order to extract human faces from larger images; such images typically contain plenty of non-face objects, such as buildings, landscapes, and various body parts.</p>\n<p>Facial detection algorithms usually begin by seeking out human eyes, which are one of the easiest facial features to detect. Next, the algorithm might try to find the mouth, nose, eyebrows, and iris. After identifying these facial features, and the algorithm concludes that it has extracted a face, it then goes through additional tests to confirm that it is, indeed, a face.</p>\n<p>To make algorithms as accurate as possible, they must be trained with huge data sets that contain hundreds of thousands of images. Some of these images contain faces, while others do not. The training procedures help the algorithm’s ability to decide whether an image contains faces, and where those facial regions are located.</p>\n<p>Also, now would be a good time to give you definitions of the main types of algorithms – ML, AI, and Deep Learning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>: ML algorithms use statistics to find patterns in huge amounts of data. This data can include words, numbers, images, clicks, and more. ML is the process behind many modern services – voice assistants (Siri and Alexa), search engines (Google and Baidu), and recommendation systems (Spotify and Netflix);</li>\n<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>: If an ML solution is programmed to learn how to perform a task, rather than just simple performance, then it is AI. Systems that use AI demonstrate behaviors similar to human intelligence – for instance, problem solving, planning, learning, perception, manipulation, and reasoning;</li>\n<li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> This algorithm is a subset of machine learning, and it is what forms deep neural networks; essentially, machines are given a greater ability to find and amplify tiny patterns. Such networks have any layers of computational nodes that collaborate to sift through data and deliver predictions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, as for the exact technologies used to develop face detection applications; these include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OpenCV;</li>\n<li>Matlab;</li>\n<li>Tensorflow;</li>\n<li>Neural Networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these follow almost the exact same procedure for face detection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FACE-DETECTION-METHODS\"><a href=\"#FACE-DETECTION-METHODS\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"FACE DETECTION METHODS\"></a>FACE DETECTION METHODS</h3><p>Three researchers from the University of California, David Kriegman, Ming-Hsuan Yang, and Narendra Ahuja, published a classification of facial detection methods. There are four classifiable categories, of which face detection algorithms can belong to 2+ groups. Let’s take a look at each category.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Feature-Based-Method\"><a href=\"#Feature-Based-Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Feature-Based Method\"></a>Feature-Based Method</h4><p>This method located faces by extracting structural features. First, an algorithm is trained as a classifier. Next, it is used to sort facial regions from non-facial regions. The general idea is to move past humans’ instinctive knowledge of faces. When feature-based approaches tackle photos with many faces, they have a 94% success rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Features such as a person’s nose or eyes are used to detect a face.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Knowledge-Based-Method\"><a href=\"#Knowledge-Based-Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Knowledge-Based Method\"></a>Knowledge-Based Method</h4><p>A knowledge-based algorithm is dependent upon a set of rules, and it is built on human knowledge. For instance, “rules” might include that a face should have eyes, a nose, and a mouth in certain positions relative to each other. However, this kind of method comes with one huge challenge: it is very difficult to build an appropriate rules set. If the rules are too general, there may be many false positives – and, conversely, if the rules are too detailed, the system could generate many false negatives.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A face is determined based on whether it meets a set of rules made by a human.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Template-Matching-Method\"><a href=\"#Template-Matching-Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Template Matching Method\"></a>Template Matching Method</h4><p>With a template matching algorithm, parameterized or pre-defined templates are used to locate or detect faces – the system measures the correlation between the input photos and the templates. For instance, the template may show that a human face is divided into nose, mouth, eyes, and face contour regions. Also, a facial model could be comprised of just edges and use the edge detection method – implementation of this approach is easy, but it is insufficient for face detection.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Images are compared to standard face patterns that have been previously stored.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Appearance-Based-Method\"><a href=\"#Appearance-Based-Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appearance-Based Method\"></a>Appearance-Based Method</h4><p>An appearance-based algorithm uses a set of training images to “learn” what a face should look like. In general, this method relies on machine learning and statistical analysis to determine relevant facial characteristics. An appearance-based approach is generally considered to be stronger than the previously mentioned methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Statistical analysis and machine learning are combined to find a face image’s characteristics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FACE-DETECTION-TECHNIQUES\"><a href=\"#FACE-DETECTION-TECHNIQUES\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"FACE DETECTION TECHNIQUES\"></a>FACE DETECTION TECHNIQUES</h3><p>Some of the more specific facial detection techniques include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Removing the background. Let’s say an image has a pre-defined, static background or a plain, single-color background – removing it can help determine the face’s boundaries;</li>\n<li>With color images, the color of the skin can sometimes be used to find faces;</li>\n<li>Motion can be used to detect faces. In a real-time video, a person’s face is nearly always in motion. However, a drawback of this technique is that a face could be confused with other moving objects.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When the aforementioned strategies are combined, they can create a comprehensive face detection approach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"WHAT-ARE-THE-CHALLENGES-IN-FACE-DETECTION\"><a href=\"#WHAT-ARE-THE-CHALLENGES-IN-FACE-DETECTION\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES IN FACE DETECTION?\"></a>WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES IN FACE DETECTION?</h2><p>Researchers Ashu Kumar, Amandeep Kaur, and Munish Kumar published a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326667118_Face_Detection_Techniques_A_Review\">review of face detection techniques</a>, which included a detailed explanation of the challenges that facial detection faces. To sum up their findings, the challenges in face detection include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Odd expressions. A human face might have an odd expression, making it difficult for facial detection algorithms to identify it as a face;</li>\n<li>Face occlusion. If a face is hidden by hair, a hat, a hand, glasses, or a scarf, it may result in a false negative;</li>\n<li>Illuminations. An image might not have uniform lighting effects; part of the image may be overexposed, while another part is very dark. Again, this can contribute to false negatives;</li>\n<li>Complex background. When lots of objects are present in an image, face detection’s accuracy is reduced;</li>\n<li>Too many faces. If there is a large number of human faces in an image, face detection software may have a hard time distinguishing between some of them;</li>\n<li>Low resolution. If an image’s resolution is poor, it is more difficult to detect faces;</li>\n<li>Skin color. If somebody’s skin color falls outside of the gradient that is recognized by the algorithm,<br>their face might not be detected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"HOW-DOES-FACE-DETECTION-WORK-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING\"><a href=\"#HOW-DOES-FACE-DETECTION-WORK-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"HOW DOES FACE DETECTION WORK WITH DEEP LEARNING?\"></a>HOW DOES FACE DETECTION WORK WITH DEEP LEARNING?</h2><p>As we mentioned earlier, deep learning is a subset of machine learning in which large neural networks process huge amounts of data and make complex predictions. So how does deep learning factor into face detection? Well, multiple <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02766\">deep learning methods</a> have been developed specifically for facial detection.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular deep learning approaches is the Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network – or, MTCNN. This approach is popular because it achieved cutting-edge results (for the time) on a variety of benchmark datasets – plus, it is able to use landmark detection to recognize the eyes, mouth, and other facial features.</p>\n<p>MTCNN uses a cascade structure that contains three networks: P-net, R-Net, and O-Net. The image is first rescaled to different sizes (or an image period). P-Net proposes facial regions, R-Net filters the bounding boxes, and O-Net proposes facial landmarks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"WHY-IS-FACE-DETECTION-IMPORTANT-TODAY\"><a href=\"#WHY-IS-FACE-DETECTION-IMPORTANT-TODAY\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"WHY IS FACE DETECTION IMPORTANT TODAY?\"></a>WHY IS FACE DETECTION IMPORTANT TODAY?</h2><p>Face detection is the initial step in face analysis, face tracking, and, most importantly, face recognition. The latter industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and is applied to device unlocking, banking, hospitality, law enforcement, building security, and more. Face detection is necessary for facial recognition algorithms to know which parts of an image must be used to generate faceprints.</p>\n<h2 id=\"FACE-DETECTION-VS-FACE-RECOGNITION-WHAT’S-THE-DIFFERENCE\"><a href=\"#FACE-DETECTION-VS-FACE-RECOGNITION-WHAT’S-THE-DIFFERENCE\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"FACE DETECTION VS.

The former is used for biometric verification and device unlocking, whereas the latter can also be applied to facial analysis and tracking.

Some applications include photography, lip reading, marketing, and more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FACIAL-MOTION-CAPTURE\"><a href=\"#FACIAL-MOTION-CAPTURE\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"FACIAL MOTION CAPTURE\"></a>FACIAL MOTION CAPTURE</h3><p>With applications such as Snapchat, people’s faces can be altered in real-time with fun filters. Facial detection makes this possible, as its algorithms tell the applications that there is a face that can be traced and changed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FACIAL-RECOGNITION\"><a href=\"#FACIAL-RECOGNITION\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"FACIAL RECOGNITION\"></a>FACIAL RECOGNITION</h3><p><a href=\"https://recfaces.com/articles/what-is-facial-recognition-used-for\">Facial recognition</a> adds increased security to nearly every global industry. It seeks to identify a person and then authenticate their identity – but for a person’s faceprint to be analyzed via facial recognition, the facial area to be assessed is determined by face detection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PHOTOGRAPHY\"><a href=\"#PHOTOGRAPHY\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"PHOTOGRAPHY\"></a>PHOTOGRAPHY</h3><p>Facial recognition can be used to “tag” people’s faces in photos across social media platforms, and facial detection forms the foundation of this application. Furthermore, facial detection technology can be used alongside tracking to focus on a person’s face while the photo is being taken.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MARKETING\"><a href=\"#MARKETING\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"MARKETING\"></a>MARKETING</h3><p>Facial surveillance can help stores determine customers that have visited a few times and offer them perks or discounts – thus fostering increased customer loyalty.</p>\n<h3 id=\"EMOTIONAL-INFERENCE\"><a href=\"#EMOTIONAL-INFERENCE\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"EMOTIONAL INFERENCE\"></a>EMOTIONAL INFERENCE</h3><p>Emotion recognition applications are still in the works; when they are fully developed, AI might be able to “read” nonverbal cues, gestures, body movements, and facial expressions to convey a person’s feelings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"LIP-READING\"><a href=\"#LIP-READING\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"LIP READING\"></a>LIP READING</h3><p>The detection, modeling, and tracking of lips during videos can be used to generate automatic subtitles. Such an application can be found on YouTube, where some videos have the option to turn on subtitles, even if the creator has not provided any.</p>\n<h2 id=\"SUMMARY\"><a href=\"#SUMMARY\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SUMMARY\"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>To sum up the key points of this guide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Face detection is AI-based computer technology that is used to extract and identify human faces from<br>digital images;</li>\n<li>Face detection algorithms can be feature-based, knowledge-based, template matching, appearance- based, or a combination of methods;</li>\n<li>Advantages of face detection include better security, easy integration, and automated identification;</li>\n<li>Disadvantages include huge storage requirements, vulnerable detection, and potential privacy issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Face detection is the foundation of a huge number of facial applications – we can see it in our day-to-day life. When we unlock our smartphone via face recognition, that would not be possible without face detection. The same goes for facial recognition surveillance systems, photo tagging, and Snapchat filters. There are many exciting applications in the works that we can thank face detection for!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Tutorial-Time\"><a href=\"#Tutorial-Time\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Tutorial Time\"></a>Tutorial Time</h2><p>Now we will see a small example of OpenCV and Python with its explanations, before we start we will need following software and if you are Linux base OS then you can skip installation process.

you have any issues then you can ask there.</p>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"","more":"<p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t-MDoI7MuY0/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Face Detection\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"What-is-Face-Detection\"><a href=\"#What-is-Face-Detection\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What is Face Detection?\"></a>What is Face Detection?</h2><p>Face detection is AI-based computer technology that is used to extract and identify human faces from digital images. When integrated with <a href=\"https://recfaces.com/articles/what-is-biometrics\">biometric</a> security systems (particularly, facial recognition ones), this kind of technology is what makes it possible to monitor and track people in real-time. In applications that use facial tracking, analysis, and recognition, face detection typically works as the first step and has a significant impact on how sequential operations within the app will perform.</p>\n<p>Face detection helps with facial analysis by identifying the parts of a video or an image that should be focused on when determining gender, age, and emotions. Similarly, with facial recognition systems (which create “faceprint” maps of facial features), face detection data is included in the system’s algorithms. And why? Face detection helps determine which parts of the video or image are needed to produce a faceprint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"HOW-DOES-FACE-DETECTION-WORK\"><a href=\"#HOW-DOES-FACE-DETECTION-WORK\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"HOW DOES FACE DETECTION WORK?\"></a>HOW DOES FACE DETECTION WORK?</h2><p>Face detection technology uses machine learning and algorithms in order to extract human faces from larger images; such images typically contain plenty of non-face objects, such as buildings, landscapes, and various body parts.</p>\n<p>Facial detection algorithms usually begin by seeking out human eyes, which are one of the easiest facial features to detect. Next, the algorithm might try to find the mouth, nose, eyebrows, and iris. After identifying these facial features, and the algorithm concludes that it has extracted a face, it then goes through additional tests to confirm that it is, indeed, a face.</p>\n<p>To make algorithms as accurate as possible, they must be trained with huge data sets that contain hundreds of thousands of images. Some of these images contain faces, while others do not. The training procedures help the algorithm’s ability to decide whether an image contains faces, and where those facial regions are located.</p>\n<p>Also, now would be a good time to give you definitions of the main types of algorithms – ML, AI, and Deep Learning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>: ML algorithms use statistics to find patterns in huge amounts of data. This data can include words, numbers, images, clicks, and more. ML is the process behind many modern services – voice assistants (Siri and Alexa), search engines (Google and Baidu), and recommendation systems (Spotify and Netflix);</li>\n<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>: If an ML solution is programmed to learn how to perform a task, rather than just simple performance, then it is AI. Systems that use AI demonstrate behaviors similar to human intelligence – for instance, problem solving, planning, learning, perception, manipulation, and reasoning;</li>\n<li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> This algorithm is a subset of machine learning, and it is what forms deep neural networks; essentially, machines are given a greater ability to find and amplify tiny patterns. Such networks have any layers of computational nodes that collaborate to sift through data and deliver predictions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, as for the exact technologies used to develop face detection applications; these include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OpenCV;</li>\n<li>Matlab;</li>\n<li>Tensorflow;</li>\n<li>Neural Networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these follow almost the exact same procedure for face detection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FACE-DETECTION-METHODS\"><a href=\"#FACE-DETECTION-METHODS\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"FACE DETECTION METHODS\"></a>FACE DETECTION METHODS</h3><p>Three researchers from the University of California, David Kriegman, Ming-Hsuan Yang, and Narendra Ahuja, published a classification of facial detection methods. There are four classifiable categories, of which face detection algorithms can belong to 2+ groups. Let’s take a look at each category.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Feature-Based-Method\"><a href=\"#Feature-Based-Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Feature-Based Method\"></a>Feature-Based Method</h4><p>This method located faces by extracting structural features. First, an algorithm is trained as a classifier. Next, it is used to sort facial regions from non-facial regions. The general idea is to move past humans’ instinctive knowledge of faces. When feature-based approaches tackle photos with many faces, they have a 94% success rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Features such as a person’s nose or eyes are used to detect a face.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Knowledge-Based-Method\"><a href=\"#Knowledge-Based-Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Knowledge-Based Method\"></a>Knowledge-Based Method</h4><p>A knowledge-based algorithm is dependent upon a set of rules, and it is built on human knowledge. For instance, “rules” might include that a face should have eyes, a nose, and a mouth in certain positions relative to each other. However, this kind of method comes with one huge challenge: it is very difficult to build an appropriate rules set. If the rules are too general, there may be many false positives – and, conversely, if the rules are too detailed, the system could generate many false negatives.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A face is determined based on whether it meets a set of rules made by a human.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Template-Matching-Method\"><a href=\"#Template-Matching-Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Template Matching Method\"></a>Template Matching Method</h4><p>With a template matching algorithm, parameterized or pre-defined templates are used to locate or detect faces – the system measures the correlation between the input photos and the templates. For instance, the template may show that a human face is divided into nose, mouth, eyes, and face contour regions. Also, a facial model could be comprised of just edges and use the edge detection method – implementation of this approach is easy, but it is insufficient for face detection.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Images are compared to standard face patterns that have been previously stored.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Appearance-Based-Method\"><a href=\"#Appearance-Based-Method\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Appearance-Based Method\"></a>Appearance-Based Method</h4><p>An appearance-based algorithm uses a set of training images to “learn” what a face should look like. In general, this method relies on machine learning and statistical analysis to determine relevant facial characteristics. An appearance-based approach is generally considered to be stronger than the previously mentioned methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Statistical analysis and machine learning are combined to find a face image’s characteristics.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FACE-DETECTION-TECHNIQUES\"><a href=\"#FACE-DETECTION-TECHNIQUES\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"FACE DETECTION TECHNIQUES\"></a>FACE DETECTION TECHNIQUES</h3><p>Some of the more specific facial detection techniques include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Removing the background. Let’s say an image has a pre-defined, static background or a plain, single-color background – removing it can help determine the face’s boundaries;</li>\n<li>With color images, the color of the skin can sometimes be used to find faces;</li>\n<li>Motion can be used to detect faces. In a real-time video, a person’s face is nearly always in motion. However, a drawback of this technique is that a face could be confused with other moving objects.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When the aforementioned strategies are combined, they can create a comprehensive face detection approach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"WHAT-ARE-THE-CHALLENGES-IN-FACE-DETECTION\"><a href=\"#WHAT-ARE-THE-CHALLENGES-IN-FACE-DETECTION\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES IN FACE DETECTION?\"></a>WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES IN FACE DETECTION?</h2><p>Researchers Ashu Kumar, Amandeep Kaur, and Munish Kumar published a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326667118_Face_Detection_Techniques_A_Review\">review of face detection techniques</a>, which included a detailed explanation of the challenges that facial detection faces. To sum up their findings, the challenges in face detection include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Odd expressions. A human face might have an odd expression, making it difficult for facial detection algorithms to identify it as a face;</li>\n<li>Face occlusion. If a face is hidden by hair, a hat, a hand, glasses, or a scarf, it may result in a false negative;</li>\n<li>Illuminations. An image might not have uniform lighting effects; part of the image may be overexposed, while another part is very dark. Again, this can contribute to false negatives;</li>\n<li>Complex background. When lots of objects are present in an image, face detection’s accuracy is reduced;</li>\n<li>Too many faces. If there is a large number of human faces in an image, face detection software may have a hard time distinguishing between some of them;</li>\n<li>Low resolution. If an image’s resolution is poor, it is more difficult to detect faces;</li>\n<li>Skin color. If somebody’s skin color falls outside of the gradient that is recognized by the algorithm,<br>their face might not be detected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"HOW-DOES-FACE-DETECTION-WORK-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING\"><a href=\"#HOW-DOES-FACE-DETECTION-WORK-WITH-DEEP-LEARNING\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"HOW DOES FACE DETECTION WORK WITH DEEP LEARNING?\"></a>HOW DOES FACE DETECTION WORK WITH DEEP LEARNING?</h2><p>As we mentioned earlier, deep learning is a subset of machine learning in which large neural networks process huge amounts of data and make complex predictions. So how does deep learning factor into face detection? Well, multiple <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02766\">deep learning methods</a> have been developed specifically for facial detection.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular deep learning approaches is the Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network – or, MTCNN. This approach is popular because it achieved cutting-edge results (for the time) on a variety of benchmark datasets – plus, it is able to use landmark detection to recognize the eyes, mouth, and other facial features.</p>\n<p>MTCNN uses a cascade structure that contains three networks: P-net, R-Net, and O-Net. The image is first rescaled to different sizes (or an image period). P-Net proposes facial regions, R-Net filters the bounding boxes, and O-Net proposes facial landmarks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"WHY-IS-FACE-DETECTION-IMPORTANT-TODAY\"><a href=\"#WHY-IS-FACE-DETECTION-IMPORTANT-TODAY\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"WHY IS FACE DETECTION IMPORTANT TODAY?\"></a>WHY IS FACE DETECTION IMPORTANT TODAY?</h2><p>Face detection is the initial step in face analysis, face tracking, and, most importantly, face recognition. The latter industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and is applied to device unlocking, banking, hospitality, law enforcement, building security, and more. Face detection is necessary for facial recognition algorithms to know which parts of an image must be used to generate faceprints.</p>\n<h2 id=\"FACE-DETECTION-VS-FACE-RECOGNITION-WHAT’S-THE-DIFFERENCE\"><a href=\"#FACE-DETECTION-VS-FACE-RECOGNITION-WHAT’S-THE-DIFFERENCE\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"FACE DETECTION VS. FACE RECOGNITION: WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?\"></a>FACE DETECTION VS. FACE RECOGNITION: WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?</h2><p>Facial recognition is merely one application of face detection. The former is used for biometric verification and device unlocking, whereas the latter can also be applied to facial analysis and tracking.

Let’s take a look at the advantages and disadvantages that face detection systems can bring.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ADVANTAGES-OF-FACE-DETECTION\"><a href=\"#ADVANTAGES-OF-FACE-DETECTION\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ADVANTAGES OF FACE DETECTION\"></a>ADVANTAGES OF FACE DETECTION</h3><ol>\n<li>Better security. Face detection augments surveillance tactics and forms the basis of the identification process of terrorists and criminals;</li>\n<li>Easy to integrate. Most face detection solutions are compatible with security software;</li>\n<li>Automated identification. Face detection lets facial identification be automated, thus increasing efficiency alongside a heightened rate of accuracy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"DISADVANTAGES-OF-FACE-DETECTION\"><a href=\"#DISADVANTAGES-OF-FACE-DETECTION\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"DISADVANTAGES OF FACE DETECTION\"></a>DISADVANTAGES OF FACE DETECTION</h3><ol>\n<li>Huge storage requirements. Machine learning technology requires powerful data storage;</li>\n<li>Detection can be vulnerable.

Some applications include photography, lip reading, marketing, and more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FACIAL-MOTION-CAPTURE\"><a href=\"#FACIAL-MOTION-CAPTURE\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"FACIAL MOTION CAPTURE\"></a>FACIAL MOTION CAPTURE</h3><p>With applications such as Snapchat, people’s faces can be altered in real-time with fun filters. Facial detection makes this possible, as its algorithms tell the applications that there is a face that can be traced and changed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"FACIAL-RECOGNITION\"><a href=\"#FACIAL-RECOGNITION\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"FACIAL RECOGNITION\"></a>FACIAL RECOGNITION</h3><p><a href=\"https://recfaces.com/articles/what-is-facial-recognition-used-for\">Facial recognition</a> adds increased security to nearly every global industry. It seeks to identify a person and then authenticate their identity – but for a person’s faceprint to be analyzed via facial recognition, the facial area to be assessed is determined by face detection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"PHOTOGRAPHY\"><a href=\"#PHOTOGRAPHY\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"PHOTOGRAPHY\"></a>PHOTOGRAPHY</h3><p>Facial recognition can be used to “tag” people’s faces in photos across social media platforms, and facial detection forms the foundation of this application. Furthermore, facial detection technology can be used alongside tracking to focus on a person’s face while the photo is being taken.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MARKETING\"><a href=\"#MARKETING\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"MARKETING\"></a>MARKETING</h3><p>Facial surveillance can help stores determine customers that have visited a few times and offer them perks or discounts – thus fostering increased customer loyalty.</p>\n<h3 id=\"EMOTIONAL-INFERENCE\"><a href=\"#EMOTIONAL-INFERENCE\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"EMOTIONAL INFERENCE\"></a>EMOTIONAL INFERENCE</h3><p>Emotion recognition applications are still in the works; when they are fully developed, AI might be able to “read” nonverbal cues, gestures, body movements, and facial expressions to convey a person’s feelings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"LIP-READING\"><a href=\"#LIP-READING\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"LIP READING\"></a>LIP READING</h3><p>The detection, modeling, and tracking of lips during videos can be used to generate automatic subtitles. Such an application can be found on YouTube, where some videos have the option to turn on subtitles, even if the creator has not provided any.</p>\n<h2 id=\"SUMMARY\"><a href=\"#SUMMARY\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SUMMARY\"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>To sum up the key points of this guide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Face detection is AI-based computer technology that is used to extract and identify human faces from<br>digital images;</li>\n<li>Face detection algorithms can be feature-based, knowledge-based, template matching, appearance- based, or a combination of methods;</li>\n<li>Advantages of face detection include better security, easy integration, and automated identification;</li>\n<li>Disadvantages include huge storage requirements, vulnerable detection, and potential privacy issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Face detection is the foundation of a huge number of facial applications – we can see it in our day-to-day life. When we unlock our smartphone via face recognition, that would not be possible without face detection. The same goes for facial recognition surveillance systems, photo tagging, and Snapchat filters. There are many exciting applications in the works that we can thank face detection for!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Tutorial-Time\"><a href=\"#Tutorial-Time\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Tutorial Time\"></a>Tutorial Time</h2><p>Now we will see a small example of OpenCV and Python with its explanations, before we start we will need following software and if you are Linux base OS then you can skip installation process.

Somani announced that his office had authorised two COVID-19 vaccine candidates for restricted use in the country. With the statement, India officially stood at the cusp of one of the world’s largest vaccination drives. But while the moment is suffused with hope, it will pay to remember at all times what exactly will happen from today: not a well-understood or well-planned event, and still hinged – for all the celebration of the science – on good luck.\n\nWithin hours of the UK approving AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, the company began rolling out thousands of doses for distribution among the country’s high-priority groups. This kind of speed would have been possible only if AstraZeneca had assumed the candidate would be approved and had amassed enough doses for distribution at the country’s doorstep. But while this attitude could seem presumptuous and off-putting at other times, it’s apparently necessary during an ongoing pandemic – especially with a [more contagious form](https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/novel-coronavirus-d614g-mutation-rna-virus-replication-covid-19-pandemic/) of the virus showing up recently, and the AstraZeneca candidate being the cheaper option by far.\n\nAt least, this is the excuse many people, including some experts, are advancing for rushing various aspects of vaccine production and distribution as much as possible. This is unfortunate. The pandemic is only part of the reason, and perhaps even in the minority, among all reasons that AstraZeneca is accelerating its candidate’s availability. A major one is that the Pfizer/BioNTech collaboration has taken a big lead in the US and the UK with its high-efficacy mRNA vaccine candidate, with Moderna a close second in the US market.\n\nAll three candidates are two-shot vaccines, and the total population of the US and the UK is nearly 400 million. So given current manufacturing capacity, no single candidate will single-handedly be able to sate demands in both markets, especially since demand is also high. So all three candidates are certainly in contention.\n\nHowever, these companies have all been making their moves with at least one eye planted on the stock-markets. Stories of Pfizer’s windfall and the profits for its CEO when its candidate was approved for emergency use in the US are already part of pandemic lore. According to [one estimate](https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-vaccine-universally-available-big-pharma-monopolies/), the company is set to make $13 billion in profits in 2021 alone. So as such AstraZeneca is already late, and if it is to catch up, it must become available asap in the US and the UK, and try to press a first-mover advantage where it can.\n\n### Pressing the advantage\n\nIndia is one such place. The Serum Institute of India has a deal with AstraZeneca to manufacture its candidate for sale in other markets, as well as to make and distribute doses for sale in India, under the name ‘Covishield’. On January 1, the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) recommended that the vaccine candidate be approved for restricted use. On January 3, DCGI Dr Somani approved the candidate, as well as Bharat Biotech’s counterpart, named Covaxin.\n\nThe speed is awe-inspiring – but in India, it may also be a quirk of doing business. As *The Wire* [has reported](https://thewire.in/health/adar-poonawalla-serum-institute-covid-19-vaccine), “American and European governments have promised vaccine-makers billions of dollars to offset potential losses” in exchange for the makers to start manufacturing even before candidates are approved. But at least as of August 2020, the Indian government hadn’t made any such promises, leaving only companies that could afford to write-off large losses with the ability to start manufacturing early. Serum Institute was one such company. Its CEO Adar Poonawalla [told *New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/asia/coronavirus-vaccine-india.html) that it wanted to get a head-start because it could afford to, after investing upwards of Rs 3,300 crore.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Happy new year, everyone! All the risks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SerumInstIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SerumInstIndia</a> took with stockpiling the vaccine, have finally paid off.

The former has sued the latter for Rs 5 crore, by way of compensation for a neurological side-effect that the participant has claimed arose as a result of being administered Covishield. Serum Institute subsequently threatened to counter-sue for Rs 100 crore, alleging defamation.\n\nAs Shreya Dasgupta [reported for *The Wire Science*](https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-serum-institute-clinical-trials-chennai-volunteer-communication-ethics-dcgi/), Serum Institute’s response doesn’t inspire confidence in its version of events – more so since informed consent in the context of clinical trials is not as iron-clad an indemnification as some might think.\n\nAstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate is also knee-deep in trouble in the UK, where an advisory group to the government has expressed doubts about the company’s claim that the candidate could be more effective if the first of its two doses is halved in quantity. This claim arose from an accident during its phase 2 clinical trials, when a subgroup of participants received a full dose + half dose regimen by mistake, but which still reported 28 percentage points more efficacy. The company got in even more trouble after it [became known](https://www.wired.com/story/the-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-data-isnt-up-to-snuff/) that it may have cherry-picked data from its trials to share with governments for approval.\n\nSerum Institute only appears to be following suit. The company is conducting bridging trials in India, which can help find if a vaccine candidate tested elsewhere will elicit an immune response in the Indian population as well. Out of a pool of 1,600 participants, Serum Institute submitted data pertaining to only 100 volunteers to the CDSCO’s subject expert committee, [*The Hindu* reported](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-serum-institute-of-indias-covid-19-vaccine-covishield-likely-to-be-approved-for-emergency-use-in-india/article33472324.ece). Bear in mind that this is a vaccine to be distributed to over a billion people in India alone, and the committee has recommended it based on data from only a hundred of them.\n\nAs for Bharat Biotech: the Covaxin vaccine candidate’s efficacy data isn’t in the public domain – nor are details from its phase 1 and 2 clinical trials and about how the company has estimated the figure [to be around 60%](https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-bharat-biotechs-covaxin-expected-to-be-60-effective-company-says/). That the DCGI’s approval is [entirely opaque](https://science.thewire.in/health/biocon-itolizumab-covid-national-task-force-19-dcgi-approval-phase-2-cdsco/) only makes this more of a problem.\n\n### Sidestepping criticism\n\n![img](https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03115608/Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-11.55.32-AM.png)\n\nDr V.G. Somani addressing the press on January 3, 2021. Source: PIB/YouTube\n\nThat’s not all. The head of the UK advisory group, Munir Pirmohamed, [recently said](https://science.thewire.in/health/still-in-the-weeds-uk-nod-for-astrazeneca-vaccine-raises-more-questions/) that when the group analysed the data AstraZeneca had submitted for its candidate’s approval, it found that the higher efficacy in the subgroup of participants that received the full-dose/half-dose regimen could in fact have been the result of a longer gap between the two doses, and not the altered dose volume.\n\nThe UK [has since approved](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-second-dose-the-hindu-editorial-on-covid-19-vaccine-clearance-in-india/article33475177.ece) a strategy to distribute the first dose to recipients as quickly as possible, since there is enough data to believe it provokes an immune response. However, we don’t know how the strength and duration of the response will vary in time, and whether the candidate will be just as efficacious if the second dose is delayed by more than a certain period. And yet again there is a caveat: the strategy to increase the gap between the two doses may not just be because the efficacy may be higher, but also because AstraZeneca may be [having issues](https://app.box.com/s/uwwn2dv4o2d0ena726gf4403f3p2acnu) with supply!\n\nIsn’t this a shoddy path to vaccine approval, full of serendipities and experimental manoeuvres? As drug-discovery chemist [Derek Lowe said](https://twitter.com/Dereklowe/status/1344644941339889669), the pandemic, and the virus’s new mutation that allows it to spread faster through populations, may still be able to make a good case to support this kind of breakneck speed – but neither the UK government nor anyone else actually knows what they are doing. It’s a dice-roll (with a somewhat loaded die, but still) to be performed with millions of people, in the hopes that a vaccine candidate will work as intended. And AstraZeneca is not alone here.\n\nAs Sandhya Srinivasan, consulting editor at the *Indian Journal of Medical Ethics*, [wrote late last year](https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-vaccines-immunisation-insufficient-tests-financial-stake-vaccine-related-injuries/), we don’t have vaccines – we have vaccine candidates. This is an important distinction because the candidates have been or are being tested in a way that doesn’t check if they’re good at preventing severe illness and if they are safe for the high-priority groups who will receive the first doses – especially the elderly. Both Srinivasan and S. Swaminathan, a retired scientist in New Delhi, have also [expressed concerns](https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-clinical-trials-adverse-events-severe-disease-proven-technology/) about clinical trials overestimating vaccine efficacy by relaxing the threshold of effects.\n\nBut the most pernicious defence of these practices has been to accuse anyone who asks uncomfortable questions of being “anti-vaxxers”. Anti-vaxx is short for ‘anti-vaccination’, a [movement opposed to using vaccines](https://science.thewire.in/health/mmr-vaccination-autism/) to eliminate diseases because its members believe vaccines *cause* diseases instead. Anti-vaxxers are typically supporters of far-right ideologies, but those heaping the accusation on demands for accountability are assuming a similarly extreme, and unfeasible, position.\n\nIn India at least, the drug approval process might as well not happen, considering the extent to which it is shrouded in secrecy, even as corporate leaders use high-handed tactics and even [arguments of nationalism](https://twitter.com/kiranshaw/status/1283371081089216512) to shutdown complaints of malpractice and wrongdoing.\n\n### Vaccine apartheid\n\nPiling on top of this is the newly emerging – but historically familiar – “vaccine apartheid”. As [*The Intercept* reported](https://theintercept.com/2020/12/31/covid-vaccine-countries-scarcity-access/) on December 31, 2020, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine candidate was tested in clinical trials with almost 44,000 participants across “Argentina, South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey as well as the US”. However,\n\n> Argentina, South Africa, Brazil and Turkey will have to be satisfied with Pfizer’s gratitude, because … they won’t be receiving enough of the vaccine to inoculate their populations, at least not anytime soon. Meanwhile, the US and Germany — along with Canada and the rest of the EU — have contracted for enough doses of various COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate their populations several times over.\n\nA similar story of discrimination played out vis-à-vis severe adverse events during the trials of AstraZeneca’s candidate. When such an event [was reported](https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/) in the UK trials, the company responded by temporarily halting the trials and launching an enquiry based on a set of predetermined, [well-understood guidelines](https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-participant-illness-aefi-data-safety-what-next/). News of the event also hit the headlines worldwide within a day or two. Once the enquiry concluded, the trials resumed without any glitches.\n\nIn India, however, Serum Institute claims it followed a similar process, as required under Indian law, but which culminated with the participant filing a case against the company. In addition, the event had occurred in early October but came to light only in late November. Other participants of the same trial also said they were contemplating legal action because they hadn’t been informed of the event.\n\nIn the richer west, vaccine-makers’ attitude seems to be “what’s there to hide”. But in India, and other similar ‘developing countries’, it’s “what’s there to see”. This is why stakeholders – which is practically everyone – must ask more questions and seek more clarity about how vaccine candidates are being approved and sold in India. ‘Cancelling’ those who disagree would be tantamount to ‘cancelling’ ourselves.\n\n","source":"_posts/India-Approves-Two-Vaccine-Candidates-But-Lets-Not-Pretend-Everything-Is-Okay.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"India Approves Two Vaccine Candidates but Let's Not Pretend Everything Is Okay\"\ndate: 2021-01-04 14:22:07\ndescription: \"India stands at the cusp of one of the world's largest vaccination drives – but while the moment is suffused with hope, a lot still depends on good luck.\"\ndraft: false\nhideToc: false\nenableToc: true\nenableTocContent: false\nauthor: Siddh Mistry\nauthorEmoji: 🤯\nurl: /india-approved-vaccination/\npinned: false\ntags:\n- corona\n- vaccination\nseries:\n- World\ncategories:\n- medical\n- vaccination\ncover: images/posts/COVIshield.jpg\n---\n\n## Vaccination Approved\n\nIn a short, eight-minute statement at 11 am on January 3, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) Dr V.G.

As [*The Intercept* reported](https://theintercept.com/2020/12/31/covid-vaccine-countries-scarcity-access/) on December 31, 2020, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine candidate was tested in clinical trials with almost 44,000 participants across “Argentina, South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey as well as the US”. However,\n\n> Argentina, South Africa, Brazil and Turkey will have to be satisfied with Pfizer’s gratitude, because … they won’t be receiving enough of the vaccine to inoculate their populations, at least not anytime soon. Meanwhile, the US and Germany — along with Canada and the rest of the EU — have contracted for enough doses of various COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate their populations several times over.\n\nA similar story of discrimination played out vis-à-vis severe adverse events during the trials of AstraZeneca’s candidate. When such an event [was reported](https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/) in the UK trials, the company responded by temporarily halting the trials and launching an enquiry based on a set of predetermined, [well-understood guidelines](https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-participant-illness-aefi-data-safety-what-next/). News of the event also hit the headlines worldwide within a day or two. Once the enquiry concluded, the trials resumed without any glitches.\n\nIn India, however, Serum Institute claims it followed a similar process, as required under Indian law, but which culminated with the participant filing a case against the company. In addition, the event had occurred in early October but came to light only in late November. Other participants of the same trial also said they were contemplating legal action because they hadn’t been informed of the event.\n\nIn the richer west, vaccine-makers’ attitude seems to be “what’s there to hide”. But in India, and other similar ‘developing countries’, it’s “what’s there to see”. This is why stakeholders – which is practically everyone – must ask more questions and seek more clarity about how vaccine candidates are being approved and sold in India. ‘Cancelling’ those who disagree would be tantamount to ‘cancelling’ ourselves.\n\n","slug":"India-Approves-Two-Vaccine-Candidates-But-Lets-Not-Pretend-Everything-Is-Okay","published":1,"updated":"2025-01-10T03:40:13.644Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cm5uu6j680015t3yr887t86w0","content":"<h2 id=\"Vaccination-Approved\"><a href=\"#Vaccination-Approved\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Vaccination Approved\"></a>Vaccination Approved</h2><p>In a short, eight-minute statement at 11 am on January 3, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) Dr V.G. Somani announced that his office had authorised two COVID-19 vaccine candidates for restricted use in the country. With the statement, India officially stood at the cusp of one of the world’s largest vaccination drives. But while the moment is suffused with hope, it will pay to remember at all times what exactly will happen from today: not a well-understood or well-planned event, and still hinged – for all the celebration of the science – on good luck.</p>\n<p>Within hours of the UK approving AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, the company began rolling out thousands of doses for distribution among the country’s high-priority groups. This kind of speed would have been possible only if AstraZeneca had assumed the candidate would be approved and had amassed enough doses for distribution at the country’s doorstep. But while this attitude could seem presumptuous and off-putting at other times, it’s apparently necessary during an ongoing pandemic – especially with a <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/novel-coronavirus-d614g-mutation-rna-virus-replication-covid-19-pandemic/\">more contagious form</a> of the virus showing up recently, and the AstraZeneca candidate being the cheaper option by far.</p>\n<p>At least, this is the excuse many people, including some experts, are advancing for rushing various aspects of vaccine production and distribution as much as possible. This is unfortunate. The pandemic is only part of the reason, and perhaps even in the minority, among all reasons that AstraZeneca is accelerating its candidate’s availability. A major one is that the Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech collaboration has taken a big lead in the US and the UK with its high-efficacy mRNA vaccine candidate, with Moderna a close second in the US market.</p>\n<p>All three candidates are two-shot vaccines, and the total population of the US and the UK is nearly 400 million. So given current manufacturing capacity, no single candidate will single-handedly be able to sate demands in both markets, especially since demand is also high. So all three candidates are certainly in contention.</p>\n<p>However, these companies have all been making their moves with at least one eye planted on the stock-markets. Stories of Pfizer’s windfall and the profits for its CEO when its candidate was approved for emergency use in the US are already part of pandemic lore. According to <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-vaccine-universally-available-big-pharma-monopolies/\">one estimate</a>, the company is set to make $13 billion in profits in 2021 alone. So as such AstraZeneca is already late, and if it is to catch up, it must become available asap in the US and the UK, and try to press a first-mover advantage where it can.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Pressing-the-advantage\"><a href=\"#Pressing-the-advantage\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Pressing the advantage\"></a>Pressing the advantage</h3><p>India is one such place. The Serum Institute of India has a deal with AstraZeneca to manufacture its candidate for sale in other markets, as well as to make and distribute doses for sale in India, under the name ‘Covishield’. On January 1, the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) recommended that the vaccine candidate be approved for restricted use. On January 3, DCGI Dr Somani approved the candidate, as well as Bharat Biotech’s counterpart, named Covaxin.</p>\n<p>The speed is awe-inspiring – but in India, it may also be a quirk of doing business. As <em>The Wire</em> <a href=\"https://thewire.in/health/adar-poonawalla-serum-institute-covid-19-vaccine\">has reported</a>, “American and European governments have promised vaccine-makers billions of dollars to offset potential losses” in exchange for the makers to start manufacturing even before candidates are approved. But at least as of August 2020, the Indian government hadn’t made any such promises, leaving only companies that could afford to write-off large losses with the ability to start manufacturing early. Serum Institute was one such company. Its CEO Adar Poonawalla <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/world/asia/coronavirus-vaccine-india.html\">told <em>New York Times</em></a> that it wanted to get a head-start because it could afford to, after investing upwards of Rs 3,300 crore.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Happy new year, everyone!

The former has sued the latter for Rs 5 crore, by way of compensation for a neurological side-effect that the participant has claimed arose as a result of being administered Covishield. Serum Institute subsequently threatened to counter-sue for Rs 100 crore, alleging defamation.</p>\n<p>As Shreya Dasgupta <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-serum-institute-clinical-trials-chennai-volunteer-communication-ethics-dcgi/\">reported for <em>The Wire Science</em></a>, Serum Institute’s response doesn’t inspire confidence in its version of events – more so since informed consent in the context of clinical trials is not as iron-clad an indemnification as some might think.</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate is also knee-deep in trouble in the UK, where an advisory group to the government has expressed doubts about the company’s claim that the candidate could be more effective if the first of its two doses is halved in quantity. This claim arose from an accident during its phase 2 clinical trials, when a subgroup of participants received a full dose + half dose regimen by mistake, but which still reported 28 percentage points more efficacy. The company got in even more trouble after it <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-data-isnt-up-to-snuff/\">became known</a> that it may have cherry-picked data from its trials to share with governments for approval.</p>\n<p>Serum Institute only appears to be following suit. The company is conducting bridging trials in India, which can help find if a vaccine candidate tested elsewhere will elicit an immune response in the Indian population as well. Out of a pool of 1,600 participants, Serum Institute submitted data pertaining to only 100 volunteers to the CDSCO’s subject expert committee, <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-serum-institute-of-indias-covid-19-vaccine-covishield-likely-to-be-approved-for-emergency-use-in-india/article33472324.ece\"><em>The Hindu</em> reported</a>. Bear in mind that this is a vaccine to be distributed to over a billion people in India alone, and the committee has recommended it based on data from only a hundred of them.</p>\n<p>As for Bharat Biotech: the Covaxin vaccine candidate’s efficacy data isn’t in the public domain – nor are details from its phase 1 and 2 clinical trials and about how the company has estimated the figure <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-bharat-biotechs-covaxin-expected-to-be-60-effective-company-says/\">to be around 60%</a>. That the DCGI’s approval is <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/health/biocon-itolizumab-covid-national-task-force-19-dcgi-approval-phase-2-cdsco/\">entirely opaque</a> only makes this more of a problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Sidestepping-criticism\"><a href=\"#Sidestepping-criticism\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Sidestepping criticism\"></a>Sidestepping criticism</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03115608/Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-11.55.32-AM.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<p>Dr V.G. Somani addressing the press on January 3, 2021. Source: PIB&#x2F;YouTube</p>\n<p>That’s not all. The head of the UK advisory group, Munir Pirmohamed, <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/health/still-in-the-weeds-uk-nod-for-astrazeneca-vaccine-raises-more-questions/\">recently said</a> that when the group analysed the data AstraZeneca had submitted for its candidate’s approval, it found that the higher efficacy in the subgroup of participants that received the full-dose&#x2F;half-dose regimen could in fact have been the result of a longer gap between the two doses, and not the altered dose volume.</p>\n<p>The UK <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-second-dose-the-hindu-editorial-on-covid-19-vaccine-clearance-in-india/article33475177.ece\">has since approved</a> a strategy to distribute the first dose to recipients as quickly as possible, since there is enough data to believe it provokes an immune response. However, we don’t know how the strength and duration of the response will vary in time, and whether the candidate will be just as efficacious if the second dose is delayed by more than a certain period. And yet again there is a caveat: the strategy to increase the gap between the two doses may not just be because the efficacy may be higher, but also because AstraZeneca may be <a href=\"https://app.box.com/s/uwwn2dv4o2d0ena726gf4403f3p2acnu\">having issues</a> with supply!</p>\n<p>Isn’t this a shoddy path to vaccine approval, full of serendipities and experimental manoeuvres? As drug-discovery chemist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dereklowe/status/1344644941339889669\">Derek Lowe said</a>, the pandemic, and the virus’s new mutation that allows it to spread faster through populations, may still be able to make a good case to support this kind of breakneck speed – but neither the UK government nor anyone else actually knows what they are doing. It’s a dice-roll (with a somewhat loaded die, but still) to be performed with millions of people, in the hopes that a vaccine candidate will work as intended. And AstraZeneca is not alone here.</p>\n<p>As Sandhya Srinivasan, consulting editor at the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em>, <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-vaccines-immunisation-insufficient-tests-financial-stake-vaccine-related-injuries/\">wrote late last year</a>, we don’t have vaccines – we have vaccine candidates. This is an important distinction because the candidates have been or are being tested in a way that doesn’t check if they’re good at preventing severe illness and if they are safe for the high-priority groups who will receive the first doses – especially the elderly. Both Srinivasan and S. Swaminathan, a retired scientist in New Delhi, have also <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-clinical-trials-adverse-events-severe-disease-proven-technology/\">expressed concerns</a> about clinical trials overestimating vaccine efficacy by relaxing the threshold of effects.</p>\n<p>But the most pernicious defence of these practices has been to accuse anyone who asks uncomfortable questions of being “anti-vaxxers”. Anti-vaxx is short for ‘anti-vaccination’, a <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/health/mmr-vaccination-autism/\">movement opposed to using vaccines</a> to eliminate diseases because its members believe vaccines <em>cause</em> diseases instead.

That the DCGI’s approval is <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/health/biocon-itolizumab-covid-national-task-force-19-dcgi-approval-phase-2-cdsco/\">entirely opaque</a> only makes this more of a problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Sidestepping-criticism\"><a href=\"#Sidestepping-criticism\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Sidestepping criticism\"></a>Sidestepping criticism</h3><p><img src=\"https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03115608/Screenshot-2021-01-03-at-11.55.32-AM.png\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n<p>Dr V.G. Somani addressing the press on January 3, 2021. Source: PIB&#x2F;YouTube</p>\n<p>That’s not all. The head of the UK advisory group, Munir Pirmohamed, <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/health/still-in-the-weeds-uk-nod-for-astrazeneca-vaccine-raises-more-questions/\">recently said</a> that when the group analysed the data AstraZeneca had submitted for its candidate’s approval, it found that the higher efficacy in the subgroup of participants that received the full-dose&#x2F;half-dose regimen could in fact have been the result of a longer gap between the two doses, and not the altered dose volume.</p>\n<p>The UK <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-second-dose-the-hindu-editorial-on-covid-19-vaccine-clearance-in-india/article33475177.ece\">has since approved</a> a strategy to distribute the first dose to recipients as quickly as possible, since there is enough data to believe it provokes an immune response. However, we don’t know how the strength and duration of the response will vary in time, and whether the candidate will be just as efficacious if the second dose is delayed by more than a certain period. And yet again there is a caveat: the strategy to increase the gap between the two doses may not just be because the efficacy may be higher, but also because AstraZeneca may be <a href=\"https://app.box.com/s/uwwn2dv4o2d0ena726gf4403f3p2acnu\">having issues</a> with supply!</p>\n<p>Isn’t this a shoddy path to vaccine approval, full of serendipities and experimental manoeuvres? As drug-discovery chemist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dereklowe/status/1344644941339889669\">Derek Lowe said</a>, the pandemic, and the virus’s new mutation that allows it to spread faster through populations, may still be able to make a good case to support this kind of breakneck speed – but neither the UK government nor anyone else actually knows what they are doing. It’s a dice-roll (with a somewhat loaded die, but still) to be performed with millions of people, in the hopes that a vaccine candidate will work as intended. And AstraZeneca is not alone here.</p>\n<p>As Sandhya Srinivasan, consulting editor at the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em>, <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-vaccines-immunisation-insufficient-tests-financial-stake-vaccine-related-injuries/\">wrote late last year</a>, we don’t have vaccines – we have vaccine candidates. This is an important distinction because the candidates have been or are being tested in a way that doesn’t check if they’re good at preventing severe illness and if they are safe for the high-priority groups who will receive the first doses – especially the elderly. Both Srinivasan and S. Swaminathan, a retired scientist in New Delhi, have also <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-clinical-trials-adverse-events-severe-disease-proven-technology/\">expressed concerns</a> about clinical trials overestimating vaccine efficacy by relaxing the threshold of effects.</p>\n<p>But the most pernicious defence of these practices has been to accuse anyone who asks uncomfortable questions of being “anti-vaxxers”. Anti-vaxx is short for ‘anti-vaccination’, a <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/health/mmr-vaccination-autism/\">movement opposed to using vaccines</a> to eliminate diseases because its members believe vaccines <em>cause</em> diseases instead. Anti-vaxxers are typically supporters of far-right ideologies, but those heaping the accusation on demands for accountability are assuming a similarly extreme, and unfeasible, position.</p>\n<p>In India at least, the drug approval process might as well not happen, considering the extent to which it is shrouded in secrecy, even as corporate leaders use high-handed tactics and even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kiranshaw/status/1283371081089216512\">arguments of nationalism</a> to shutdown complaints of malpractice and wrongdoing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Vaccine-apartheid\"><a href=\"#Vaccine-apartheid\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Vaccine apartheid\"></a>Vaccine apartheid</h3><p>Piling on top of this is the newly emerging – but historically familiar – “vaccine apartheid”. As <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/12/31/covid-vaccine-countries-scarcity-access/\"><em>The Intercept</em> reported</a> on December 31, 2020, the Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech vaccine candidate was tested in clinical trials with almost 44,000 participants across “Argentina, South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey as well as the US”. However,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Argentina, South Africa, Brazil and Turkey will have to be satisfied with Pfizer’s gratitude, because … they won’t be receiving enough of the vaccine to inoculate their populations, at least not anytime soon. Meanwhile, the US and Germany — along with Canada and the rest of the EU — have contracted for enough doses of various COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate their populations several times over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A similar story of discrimination played out vis-à-vis severe adverse events during the trials of AstraZeneca’s candidate. When such an event <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/\">was reported</a> in the UK trials, the company responded by temporarily halting the trials and launching an enquiry based on a set of predetermined, <a href=\"https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-participant-illness-aefi-data-safety-what-next/\">well-understood guidelines</a>. News of the event also hit the headlines worldwide within a day or two. Once the enquiry concluded, the trials resumed without any glitches.</p>\n<p>In India, however, Serum Institute claims it followed a similar process, as required under Indian law, but which culminated with the participant filing a case against the company. In addition, the event had occurred in early October but came to light only in late November. Other participants of the same trial also said they were contemplating legal action because they hadn’t been informed of the event.</p>\n<p>In the richer west, vaccine-makers’ attitude seems to be “what’s there to hide”. But in India, and other similar ‘developing countries’, it’s “what’s there to see”. This is why stakeholders – which is practically everyone – must ask more questions and seek more clarity about how vaccine candidates are being approved and sold in India. ‘Cancelling’ those who disagree would be tantamount to ‘cancelling’ ourselves.</p>\n"},{"title":"Mutant Coronavirus Stain","date":"2020-12-24T17:14:35.000Z","description":"Coronavirus (Covid-19) Mutant: Like all viruses, the coronavirus is a shape-shifter.

The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology.","series":["World","Industrial 4.0"],"cover":"images/posts/nanotechnology.jpg","_content":"\n## What is Nanotechnology?\n![NanoTechnology](images/posts/nanotechnology.jpg)\n\nNanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study and application of extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering. It is the leading technology in the world where all the material are been made on the nanoscale level, you must have not been noticed that `Microcontroller` which we are using in our circuits and much more applications are been made up to the nanoscale level which is called `VLSI` Very Large Scale Integration. Nanotechnology is also called nanotech.\n\n## Origins\n<sup>Wikipidia</sup> The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by renowned physicist `Richard Feynman` in his talk `There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom`, in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms.\n\nThe term `Nanotechnology` was first used by `Norio Taniguchi` in `1974`, though it was not widely known. Inspired by Feynman's concepts, `K. Eric Drexler` used the term `nanotechnology` in his 1986 book [Engines of Creation: The Comming Era of Nanotechnology](https://www.pdfdrive.com/engines-of-creation-20-the-coming-era-of-nanotechnology-e158355030.html) which proposed the idea of a nanoscale \"assembler\" which would be able to build a copy of itself and the items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control. It's also been said that nanotechnology will be able to perform AI level operation which will help to eradicate those diseases which humans can't remove it, say for example `AIDS`, `Radioactive materials` from the body, also this `CoronaVirus` from current pandemic year. \n\n### Fundamental Concepts\nNanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale. This covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced. In its original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up, using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete, high performance products.\n\nOne nanometer (nm) is one billionth, or 10−9, of a meter. By comparison, typical carbon-carbon bond lengths, or the spacing between these atoms in a molecule, are in the range 0.12–0.15 nm, and a DNA double-helix has a diameter around 2 nm. On the other hand, the smallest cellular life-forms, the bacteria of the genus Mycoplasma, are around 200 nm in length. By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range 1 to 100 nm following the definition used by the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US. The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which are approximately a quarter of a nm kinetic diameter) since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules. The upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size below which phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device.[26] These new phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices which are merely miniaturised versions of an equivalent macroscopic device; such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of microtechnology.[27]\n\nTo put that scale in another context, the comparative size of a nanometer to a meter is the same as that of a marble to the size of the earth.[28] Or another way of putting it: a nanometer is the amount an average man's beard grows in the time it takes him to raise the razor to his face.[28]\n\nTwo main approaches are used in nanotechnology. In the \"bottom-up\" approach, materials and devices are built from molecular components which assemble themselves chemically by principles of molecular recognition.[29] In the \"top-down\" approach, nano-objects are constructed from larger entities without atomic-level control.[30]\n\nAreas of physics such as nanoelectronics, nanomechanics, nanophotonics and nanoionics have evolved during the last few decades to provide a basic scientific foundation of nanotechnology.\n\n### Current research\n\n#### Nanomaterials\nThe nanomaterials field includes subfields which develop or study materials having unique properties arising from their nanoscale dimensions.\n\n- Interface and colloid science has given rise to many materials which may be useful in nanotechnology, such as carbon nanotubes and other fullerenes, and various nanoparticles and nanorods. Nanomaterials with fast ion transport are related also to nanoionics and nanoelectronics.\n- Nanoscale materials can also be used for bulk applications; most present commercial applications of nanotechnology are of this flavor.\n- Progress has been made in using these materials for medical applications; see Nanomedicine.\n- Nanoscale materials such as nanopillars are sometimes used in solar cells which combats the cost of traditional silicon solar cells\n- Development of applications incorporating semiconductor nanoparticles to be used in the next generation of products, such as display technology, lighting, solar cells and biological imaging; see quantum dots.\n- Recent application of nanomaterials include a range of biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, antibacterials and biosensors.\n  \n### Research and development\nBecause of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Prior to 2012, the USA invested $3.7 billion using its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the European Union invested $1.2 billion, and Japan invested $750 million. Over sixty countries created nanotechnology research and development (R&D) programs between 2001 and 2004. In 2012, the US and EU each invested $2.1 billion on nanotechnology research, followed by Japan with $1.2 billion. Global investment reached $7.9 billion in 2012. Government funding was exceeded by corporate R&D spending on nanotechnology research, which was $10 billion in 2012. The largest corporate R&D spenders were from the US, Japan and Germany which accounted for a combined $7.1 billion.\n\n| Rank | Organization | Country | First Patents |\n| ---- | ------------ | ------- | ------------- |\n| 1    | Samsung Electronics | South Korea | 2578 |\n| 2    | Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal | Japan | 1490 |\n| 3    | IBM | United States | 1360 |\n| 4    | Toshiba | Japan | 1298 |\n| 5    | Canon Inc. | Japan | 1162 |\n| 6    | Hitachi | Japan | 1100|\n| 7    | University of California, Berkeley | United States | 1055 |\n| 8    | Panasonic | Japan | 1047 |\n| 9    | Hewlett-Packard | United States | 880 |\n| 10   | TDK | Japan | 839 |\n","source":"_posts/Nanotechnology.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Nanotechnology\"\ndate: 2021-04-20 20:43:49\ndescription: \"Nanotechnology, also shortened to nanotech, is the use of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale for industrial purposes.

Prior to 2012, the USA invested $3.7 billion using its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the European Union invested $1.2 billion, and Japan invested $750 million. Over sixty countries created nanotechnology research and development (R&D) programs between 2001 and 2004. In 2012, the US and EU each invested $2.1 billion on nanotechnology research, followed by Japan with $1.2 billion. Global investment reached $7.9 billion in 2012. Government funding was exceeded by corporate R&D spending on nanotechnology research, which was $10 billion in 2012. The largest corporate R&D spenders were from the US, Japan and Germany which accounted for a combined $7.1 billion.\n\n| Rank | Organization | Country | First Patents |\n| ---- | ------------ | ------- | ------------- |\n| 1    | Samsung Electronics | South Korea | 2578 |\n| 2    | Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal | Japan | 1490 |\n| 3    | IBM | United States | 1360 |\n| 4    | Toshiba | Japan | 1298 |\n| 5    | Canon Inc. | Japan | 1162 |\n| 6    | Hitachi | Japan | 1100|\n| 7    | University of California, Berkeley | United States | 1055 |\n| 8    | Panasonic | Japan | 1047 |\n| 9    | Hewlett-Packard | United States | 880 |\n| 10   | TDK | Japan | 839 |\n","slug":"Nanotechnology","published":1,"updated":"2025-01-10T03:40:13.644Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cm5uu6j6b0019t3yreuht13ko","content":"<h2 id=\"What-is-Nanotechnology\"><a href=\"#What-is-Nanotechnology\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What is Nanotechnology?\"></a>What is Nanotechnology?</h2><p><img src=\"/images/posts/nanotechnology.jpg\" alt=\"NanoTechnology\"></p>\n<p>Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers.

In this tutorial we we will be using docker insted of using ubuntu or any other software.\n\n\n# Requirments\n- Laptop or Desktop\n- Stable internet connection(Mobile or Router no matter which connection is it)\n- Raspberry Pi with 4GB+ ram (mine is Raspberry Pi 4 B+ model with 8GB of ram)\n- MicroSD card with a minimum of 32GB size\n- Power supply (power bank or cell phone adaptor)\n- MicroB to HDMI with monitor(optional) if you're going to use a monitor then you will be needing of keyboard\n- And most important thing a cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh)\n\n\n# Step 1 - Hardware setup\nOk first of all we need some software which will help us to flash memory card so that we can install os in the memory card to boot in pi.\n\n![Raspberry pi software](/images/posts/raspberry-pi.png)\n\nGo to [https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and download software according to your OS I'm using Zorin OS which is based on Ubuntu so I will be using the terminal. If you are using terminal use the following command\n\n```\nsudo apt install rpi-imager\n```\nas you can see in the below image I have already installed it on my device\n![Terminal](/images/posts/terminal-pi.png)\n\nGo ahead and open it up after opening it up plugin your 8GB or higher sd card on your laptop. as you can see in the image I have inserted 8GB of card\n![Disk](/images/posts/disk-pi.png)\n\nNow do the following steps as soon in the photo's \n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software.png)\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software1.png)\nSelect **Raspberry Pi OS(other)**\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software2.png)\nThen select **Raspberry Pi OS with desktop**\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software3.png)\n\nNow select your disk but before writing your os we will configure it first so that we don't have to connect any kind of ethernet cable or mini Wi-Fi. Press ` ALT + SHIFT + X ` to open secret setting \n\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software4.png)\n**Note:** set your hostname and remember it we will be needing it later\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software5.png)\nClick on Yes and let it complete it. After that, you will be granted this message so it means that it is been completed.\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software6.png)\n\n# Step 2 - Booting UP\n\nRemove your memory card from the computer and plug that it into pi and power it on, well as the pi is doing some process grab a cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) and wait for a few minutes.\n\n![A few moments later](https://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gif-a-few-moment-later.gif)\n\nOpen up your terminal and enter the following command\n\n```bash\n# as you remember I have told you to set your hostname in the software and remember it.\nssh pi@hostname.local\n```\nReplace your hostname with the hostname you have set while preparing the sd card. In my case, I have set my hostname with datacenter so my command will be like this\n\n```text\nssh pi@datacenter.local\n```\n\n![Pi Login](/images/posts/terminal-pi-login.png)\n\nas soon as you hit enter it will as you for a conformation like this\n```text\n~ ➤ ssh pi@datacenter.local                                                   \nThe authenticity of host 'datacenter.local (192.168.32.200)' can't be established.\nECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:VlnqrEfP5pLc62h2TQbN0Z4pEudRsmRQL4+LqDD6ZB8.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?\n```\nanswer it with **yes** after that it will as you for a password which we have set during the software installation. As you have given the password right then you will see that you have been login into your account successfully like I did.\n\n![Pi Login Successful](/images/posts/pi-login.png)\n\nCongratulation we have been login successfully into our pi take a break grab a cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) and relax.\n\n# Step 3 - Software setup\n\nAs we successfully login into pi first we will update the repository as well as we will be upgrading it by the following command don't worry if you haven't used Linux in your life this will be your first experience as well as it will be really easy just follow my steps.\n\n## Update and Upgradation of packages\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt full-upgrade -y\n```\n\nThe above command will update the repositories as well as it will be upgrading all the packages which are outdated so that we don't get any kind of error while installing. It will take a few minutes after all the process is completed we will check once again if there is any software that is left to upgrade by the following command.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update && sudo apt list --upgradable\n```\n\nThe following command will check whether any package is upgradable or not, if its all upgrade then it will return it with this message\n\n![Pi updated](/images/posts/pi-updated.png)\n\n## Package Installation\n\nNow we will install some few pre-required software so that we will use it properly. Follow me oh and don't forget your cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) ;)\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install nano wget git curl htop -y\nsudo init 6 # this command will restart your Raspberry PI4\n```\n\n# Step 4 - Getting docker\n\nThere is a script which will help us to easily install docker on our PI without any command just a single command and then run it. Right simple as it says lets give it a run.\n\nDownload the following scipt\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh\n```\nAfter downloading it script rut it with super user permission(root access)\n\n```bash\nsudo bash get-docker.sh\n```\n\nGrab your cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) and wait till the installtion is over\n\nOnce Docker is installed, add your login user to the docker group with the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)\n```\nFor our safty we will reboot out PI for external changes\n\n\n```bash\nsudo init 6\n```\n\nAfter rebooting just check docker verion by following command:\n\n```bash\ndocker version # if the following command wont work then add sudo in front of it\n```\n\nThis is the following version which im running right now:\n\n```text\ndocker version\nClient: Docker Engine - Community\n Version:           20.10.19\n API version:       1.41\n Go version:        go1.18.7\n Git commit:        d85ef84\n Built:             Thu Oct 13 16:45:42 2022\n OS/Arch:           linux/arm64\n Context:           default\n Experimental:      true\n\nServer: Docker Engine - Community\n Engine:\n  Version:          20.10.19\n  API version:      1.41 (minimum version 1.12)\n  Go version:       go1.18.7\n  Git commit:       c964641\n  Built:            Thu Oct 13 16:44:07 2022\n  OS/Arch:          linux/arm64\n  Experimental:     false\n containerd:\n  Version:          1.6.8\n  GitCommit:        9cd3357b7fd7218e4aec3eae239db1f68a5a6ec6\n runc:\n  Version:          1.1.4\n  GitCommit:        v1.1.4-0-g5fd4c4d\n docker-init:\n  Version:          0.19.0\n  GitCommit:        de40ad0\n```\n\n# Step 5 - Installing Docker composer\n\nDocker Compose is a tool for automating Docker projects using a YAML file. With the help of thi file you can create many project from scratch as I did.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install python3-pip -y\n```\n\n`PIP` is a tool which will help us to install docker composer. If it already install then we will move on to the next step\n\n```bash\nsudo pip3 install docker-compose\n```\n\nAfter installing docker composer we will check wheather it is installed properly or not\n\n```text\ndocker-compose version\ndocker-compose version 1.29.2, build unknown\ndocker-py version: <module 'docker.version' from '/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/docker/version.py'>\nCPython version: 3.10.7\nOpenSSL version: OpenSSL 3.0.5 5 Jul 2022\n```\n\n# Step 6 - Installation of ROS (semi-final step)\n\nBefore going further we will just give it a reboot so that we make sure that everything is working propely\n\n```bash\nsudo init 6\n```\n\nAs we have rebooted our system we will now search for our docker repository by using docker search command\n\n```bash\ndocker search siddhmistry\nNAME                   DESCRIPTION              STARS     OFFICIAL   AUTOMATED\nsiddhmistry/mrfoxie                             0                    \nsiddhmistry/ros_rpi4   ROS for Raspberry PI 4   0  \n```\n\nWe need to install second one which is second one `siddhmistry/ros_rpi4` follow the following steps\n\n```bash\nxhost +\ndocker pull siddhmistry/ros_rpi4:armhf\ndocker container run -it --name ROS_RPI4 --net=host -e DISPLAY siddhmistry/ros_rpi4:armhf\n```\n\nNow it will take come time so have a [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) break\n\n# Step 7 - Final step\n\nAs by now you have noticed that a terminator has been popped up run the following command so that we can setup our ROS System\n\n```bash\nsource /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash\necho \"source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash\" >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nAs we have completed all the steps try to run `roscore` if this commands works then you have successfully installed it. Press `Ctrl + C` to exit roscore after that type `exit` to exit it. Now that we have done everything we just need to install just a small thing which is called Portainer which will help to run this container easily\n\n# Step 8 - Installing Portainer\n\nAs we know we have already install docker so we will start installing Portainer so just follow the steps\n\nFirst, create the volume that Portainer Server will use to store its database:\n\n```bash\ndocker volume create portainer_data\n```\n\nThen, download and install the Portainer Server container:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest\n```\n\nPortainer Server has now been installed. You can check to see whether the Portainer Server container has started by running `docker ps`:\n\n```bash\ndocker ps\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS      PORTS                                                                                  NAMES             \nde5b28eb2fa9   portainer/portainer-ee:latest  \"/portainer\"             2 weeks ago   Up 9 days   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp, :::8000->8000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9443->9443/tcp, :::9443->9443/tcp   portainer\n```\n\nNow that the installation is complete, you can log into your Portainer Server instance by opening a web browser and going to: [portainer](https://localhost:9443)\n\n\n```bash\nhttps://localhost:9443\n```\n\nWhen you open the url you will be asked to steup admin username and password after login into the admin panel it looks like this\n\n![Portainer](/images/posts/portainer-admin-panel.png)\n\nHere you will see a local enviroment click on it and this page will open it up:\n\n![Portainer Enviroment](/images/posts/portainer-admin-panel-env.png)\n\nAt the left side panel you will able to see `Containers` option. When you open that page it will grant you with some containers.\n\n![Portainer Enviroment](/images/posts/portainer-admin-panel-containers.png)\n\nYou will see that there is a container name `ROS_PI4` select it and press start anf baam it started working. Portainer is a tool where it will help you control your container and also to add more containers in it. I hope you loved it.\n\n\n# Mr. Blogger\n\n## Podcast\n\n<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/show/6p14uYsO8NtWD8tM3wEd4o\" width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n\n## Social Media\n\n- Instagram - [https://instagram.com/mistrysiddh](https://instagram.com/mistrysiddh)\n- Github - [https://guthub.com/mrfoxie](https://guthub.com/mrfoxie)\n- Linkedin - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/SiddhMistry/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/SiddhMistry/)\n- Whatsapp - [Message Me](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=916355040470&text=http%3A%2F%2Fmistrysiddh.tk%2F)\n- Discord - [https://discord.gg/bPrBSbQ2W4](https://discord.gg/bPrBSbQ2W4)\n\n## Donation\n\n- Paypal - [https://paypal.me/mistrysiddh](https://paypal.me/mistrysiddh)\n- Patreon - [https://www.patreon.com/siddhmistry](https://www.patreon.com/siddhmistry)\n- Buymeacoffee - [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh)\n\n## Play Store\n\n[![Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png)](https://bit.ly/2Vch9gi)\n\n","source":"_posts/ROS-on-RaspberryPI4.md","raw":"---\ntitle: ROS on Raspberry PI 4\ndate: 2022-10-17 07:06:04\ntags:\n- new site\n- technology\n- Linux\n- industrial automation\nseries:\n- Hacking\ncategories:\n- Industrial automation\n- Hacking\n- website\ncover: https://www.tertiarycourses.com.sg/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/512x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/r/o/ros-raspberry-pi.jpg\nfeature: true\n---\n\n![ROS](https://www.tertiarycourses.com.sg/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/512x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/r/o/ros-raspberry-pi.jpg)\n\n# Overview\n\nWe will be install ROS on Raspberry PI 4 without Ubuntu.

Now that we have done everything we just need to install just a small thing which is called Portainer which will help to run this container easily\n\n# Step 8 - Installing Portainer\n\nAs we know we have already install docker so we will start installing Portainer so just follow the steps\n\nFirst, create the volume that Portainer Server will use to store its database:\n\n```bash\ndocker volume create portainer_data\n```\n\nThen, download and install the Portainer Server container:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest\n```\n\nPortainer Server has now been installed. You can check to see whether the Portainer Server container has started by running `docker ps`:\n\n```bash\ndocker ps\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS      PORTS                                                                                  NAMES             \nde5b28eb2fa9   portainer/portainer-ee:latest  \"/portainer\"             2 weeks ago   Up 9 days   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp, :::8000->8000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9443->9443/tcp, :::9443->9443/tcp   portainer\n```\n\nNow that the installation is complete, you can log into your Portainer Server instance by opening a web browser and going to: [portainer](https://localhost:9443)\n\n\n```bash\nhttps://localhost:9443\n```\n\nWhen you open the url you will be asked to steup admin username and password after login into the admin panel it looks like this\n\n![Portainer](/images/posts/portainer-admin-panel.png)\n\nHere you will see a local enviroment click on it and this page will open it up:\n\n![Portainer Enviroment](/images/posts/portainer-admin-panel-env.png)\n\nAt the left side panel you will able to see `Containers` option. When you open that page it will grant you with some containers.\n\n![Portainer Enviroment](/images/posts/portainer-admin-panel-containers.png)\n\nYou will see that there is a container name `ROS_PI4` select it and press start anf baam it started working. Portainer is a tool where it will help you control your container and also to add more containers in it. I hope you loved it.\n\n\n# Mr. Blogger\n\n## Podcast\n\n<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/show/6p14uYsO8NtWD8tM3wEd4o\" width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n\n## Social Media\n\n- Instagram - [https://instagram.com/mistrysiddh](https://instagram.com/mistrysiddh)\n- Github - [https://guthub.com/mrfoxie](https://guthub.com/mrfoxie)\n- Linkedin - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/SiddhMistry/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/SiddhMistry/)\n- Whatsapp - [Message Me](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=916355040470&text=http%3A%2F%2Fmistrysiddh.tk%2F)\n- Discord - [https://discord.gg/bPrBSbQ2W4](https://discord.gg/bPrBSbQ2W4)\n\n## Donation\n\n- Paypal - [https://paypal.me/mistrysiddh](https://paypal.me/mistrysiddh)\n- Patreon - [https://www.patreon.com/siddhmistry](https://www.patreon.com/siddhmistry)\n- Buymeacoffee - [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh)\n\n## Play Store\n\n[![Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png)](https://bit.ly/2Vch9gi)\n\n","slug":"ROS-on-RaspberryPI4","published":1,"updated":"2025-01-10T03:40:13.644Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cm5uu6j6f001ft3yrbwq1heps","content":"<p><img src=\"https://www.tertiarycourses.com.sg/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/512x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/r/o/ros-raspberry-pi.jpg\" alt=\"ROS\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"Overview\"><a href=\"#Overview\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Overview\"></a>Overview</h1><p>We will be install ROS on Raspberry PI 4 without Ubuntu.

If you are using terminal use the following command\n\n```\nsudo apt install rpi-imager\n```\nas you can see in the below image I have already installed it on my device\n![Terminal](/images/posts/terminal-pi.png)\n\nGo ahead and open it up after opening it up plugin your 8GB or higher sd card on your laptop. as you can see in the image I have inserted 8GB of card\n![Disk](/images/posts/disk-pi.png)\n\nNow do the following steps as soon in the photo's \n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software.png)\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software1.png)\nSelect **Raspberry Pi OS(other)**\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software2.png)\nThen select **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Legacy)**\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software3.png)\n\nNow select your disk but before writing your os we will configure it first so that we don't have to connect any kind of ethernet cable or mini Wi-Fi. Press ` ALT + SHIFT + X ` to open secret setting \n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software4.png)\n**Note:** set your hostname and remember it we will be needing it later\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software5.png)\nClick on Yes and let it complete it. After that, you will be granted this message so it means that it is been completed.\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software6.png)\n\n# Step 2\n\nAfter that plug, it into pi and power it on, well as the pi is doing some process grab a cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) and wait for a few minutes.\n\n![A few moments later](https://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gif-a-few-moment-later.gif)\n\nOpen up your terminal and enter the following command\n\n```\n# as you remember I have told you to set your hostname in the software and remember it.\nssh pi@hostname.local\n```\nReplace your hostname with the hostname you have set while preparing the sd card. In my case, I have set my hostname with datacenter so my command will be like this\n\n```\nssh pi@datacenter.local\n```\n\n![Pi Login](/images/posts/terminal-pi-login.png)\n\nas soon as you hit enter it will as you for a conformation like this\n```\n~ ➤ ssh pi@datacenter.local                                                   \nThe authenticity of host 'datacenter.local (192.168.32.200)' can't be established.\nECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:VlnqrEfP5pLc62h2TQbN0Z4pEudRsmRQL4+LqDD6ZB8.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?\n```\nanswer it with **yes** after that it will as you for a password which we have set during the software installation. As you have given the password right then you will see that you have been login into your account successfully like I did.\n\n![Pi Login Successful](/images/posts/pi-login.png)\n\nCongratulation we have been login successfully into our pi take a break grab a cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) and relax.\n\n\n## Step 2 Software setup\n\nAs we successfully login into pi first we will update the repository as well as we will be upgrading it by the following command don't worry if you haven't used Linux in your life this will be your first experience as well as it will be really easy just follow my steps.\n\n\n### Update and Upgradation of packages\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt full-upgrade -y\n```\nThe above command will update the repositories as well as it will be upgrading all the packages which are outdated so that we don't get any kind of error while installing our NAS software. It will take a few minutes after all the process is completed we will check once again if there is any software that is left to upgrade by the following command.\n\n```\nsudo apt update && sudo apt list --upgradable\n```\nThe following command will check whether any package is upgradable or not, if its all upgrade then it will return it with this message\n\n![Pi updated](/images/posts/pi-updated.png)\n\n### Packages installation\n\nNow we will be requirement few software for NAS to install without any error follow me\n\n```\nsudo apt install wget htop -y\n```\nThese packages are preinstalled but in some cases, these packages are not been installed so we will be making sure that it's installed.\n\n### Script installation\nThis script will not affect your network connection but if it did then I will leave a tutorial at the end of installation ([Wi-Fi setup](#wi-fi-setup)). Clear your terminal by using the `clear` command it will clear your terminal so that you can see it easily. Now past this script into the terminal so that installation start's\n\n```\nwget https://github.com/OpenMediaVault-Plugin-Developers/installScript/raw/master/install\nchmod +x install\nsudo ./install -n\n```\nSit back and relax until the process is been done till that time go ahead and give me a cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) so that I can bring up various kinds of this topic so that you can enjoy it\n\n![Install complate](/images/posts/nas-installation-complete.png)\nCongratulation it's been installed completed for our protection we will reboot our system with the following command `sudo reboot`.\n\n\n## Step 3 NAS setup on browser\nAs in [Step 2 Software setup](#step-2-software-setup) we have installed once again we will be login into ssh account to check the IP address of our Pi use the following command to check the IP address\n```\nhostname -I\n```\n![Finding IP address](/images/posts/hostname.png)\nAfter finding your IP address use that IP address and open it in the browser with `https://your_ip_address` and it will grant you this page\n\n![OpenMediaVault](/images/posts/openmediavault.png)\nNow now don't be frightened of the login page because you don't know the password and username well of course I also don't know. Just joking type the following and it will let you in\n\n```txt\nusername: admin\npassword: openmediavault\n```\nCongratulation you have successfully login, now before doing anything we will go ahead and change the password you will grant with this screen\n\n![Admin Panel](/images/posts/omv-admin.png)\n\n### Changing admin panel password\nGo to **System** >> **General Settings** >> Click on **Web Administrator Password** then enter your new password after doing that we will plug in any kind of hard drive or some sort of memory storing device\n![Password Change](/images/posts/omv-password-change.png)\n\n### Storage setup\nAs we have inserted external storage head over to **Storage** >> **Disk** and there you will be able to see your storage mounted on pi in my case I have inserted 128GB of memory card for the testing purpose also I have a few files copied into it\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/omv-disk.png)\n\nSelect the disk and then click on Wipe\n\n![Disk Wipe](/images/posts/omv-disk-wipe.png)\n\n![Disk Wipe]\n\nAs we have confirmed that our storage is been mounted on our pi now we will make a shared folder so that we can access it from any device.\n\n![Storage Delete](/images/posts/omv-storage-delete.png)\n\nNow select the quick option\n\n![Storage Delete](/images/posts/omv-storage-delete-1.png)\n\n\n### File System setup\n\nAfter wiping the data from the drive click on `File System` in the `Storage` section. Click on Add button and select `Device` and select the device and give it a label of your choice I will be giving it the name DataCenter, and make sure that you select `EXT4` in `File System`.\n\n![Adding Device](/images/posts/omv-adding-device.png)\n\nAfter hitting Yes to add device take a cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) and wait for it\n\n![Adding Device Complete](/images/posts/omv-adding-device-complete.png)\n\nSelect your device and click on the mount option to mount your device. A pop-up has been visible on the top just hit on the `Apply` button to apply changes so that to make sure that what are we going to make changes will work properly. It will take a few minutes to complete the process.\n\n### Sharing Folder setup\n![Folder Sharing](/images/posts/omv-folder-setup.png)\nNow we will head to `Sharing Folder Setup` to set up our sharing folder. Go to `Access Rights Management` > `Shared Folders`  when you will go there you will find it empty because we haven't set up any sharing folder go ahead and hit that `Add` button without any thoughts.\n![Folder Sharing Setup](/images/posts/omv-folder-setup-1.png)\n\nFill in all the details according to your need and make sure to leave `Permission` as it is until and unless you know the purpose of it. I will be labeling it as DataCenter if you want to comment on that device then you can otherwise Save it, again you will see Apply button on the top right side of the screen as shown in the image below it will take a while to apply the changes.\n\n![Folder Sharing Setup](/images/posts/omv-folder-setup-2.png)\n\nWe will permit it so that we can `Read/Write` files into it. Select your newly created folder and click `Privileges` and give `Read/Write` to both pi users. Hit save and apply.\n\n### Services Setup\n\nGo to the **Services** section and select `SMB/CIFS` as soon as you select it you will be granted a screen with soo many scary options but don't worry we will be using only 2 options only. So go ahead and click sharing in the `SMB/CIFS` section.\n\n![Samba Service](/images/posts/omv-service-smb-page.png)\n\n![Samba Service](/images/posts/omv-services-smb-share.png)\n\nGo ahead click on the `Add` button select your shared folder which you have been created. Hit save and apply don't change any other kind of options if your expert then only does it or else let it be as it is. Go back to the `SMB/CIFS` setting page and enable it. Hit save and apply.

If you are using terminal use the following command\n\n```\nsudo apt install rpi-imager\n```\nas you can see in the below image I have already installed it on my device\n![Terminal](/images/posts/terminal-pi.png)\n\nGo ahead and open it up after opening it up plugin your 8GB or higher sd card on your laptop. as you can see in the image I have inserted 8GB of card\n![Disk](/images/posts/disk-pi.png)\n\nNow do the following steps as soon in the photo's \n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software.png)\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software1.png)\nSelect **Raspberry Pi OS(other)**\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software2.png)\nThen select **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Legacy)**\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software3.png)\n\nNow select your disk but before writing your os we will configure it first so that we don't have to connect any kind of ethernet cable or mini Wi-Fi. Press ` ALT + SHIFT + X ` to open secret setting \n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software4.png)\n**Note:** set your hostname and remember it we will be needing it later\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software5.png)\nClick on Yes and let it complete it. After that, you will be granted this message so it means that it is been completed.\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/raspberrypi-software6.png)\n\n# Step 2\n\nAfter that plug, it into pi and power it on, well as the pi is doing some process grab a cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) and wait for a few minutes.\n\n![A few moments later](https://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gif-a-few-moment-later.gif)\n\nOpen up your terminal and enter the following command\n\n```\n# as you remember I have told you to set your hostname in the software and remember it.\nssh pi@hostname.local\n```\nReplace your hostname with the hostname you have set while preparing the sd card. In my case, I have set my hostname with datacenter so my command will be like this\n\n```\nssh pi@datacenter.local\n```\n\n![Pi Login](/images/posts/terminal-pi-login.png)\n\nas soon as you hit enter it will as you for a conformation like this\n```\n~ ➤ ssh pi@datacenter.local                                                   \nThe authenticity of host 'datacenter.local (192.168.32.200)' can't be established.\nECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:VlnqrEfP5pLc62h2TQbN0Z4pEudRsmRQL4+LqDD6ZB8.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?\n```\nanswer it with **yes** after that it will as you for a password which we have set during the software installation. As you have given the password right then you will see that you have been login into your account successfully like I did.\n\n![Pi Login Successful](/images/posts/pi-login.png)\n\nCongratulation we have been login successfully into our pi take a break grab a cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) and relax.\n\n\n## Step 2 Software setup\n\nAs we successfully login into pi first we will update the repository as well as we will be upgrading it by the following command don't worry if you haven't used Linux in your life this will be your first experience as well as it will be really easy just follow my steps.\n\n\n### Update and Upgradation of packages\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt full-upgrade -y\n```\nThe above command will update the repositories as well as it will be upgrading all the packages which are outdated so that we don't get any kind of error while installing our NAS software. It will take a few minutes after all the process is completed we will check once again if there is any software that is left to upgrade by the following command.\n\n```\nsudo apt update && sudo apt list --upgradable\n```\nThe following command will check whether any package is upgradable or not, if its all upgrade then it will return it with this message\n\n![Pi updated](/images/posts/pi-updated.png)\n\n### Packages installation\n\nNow we will be requirement few software for NAS to install without any error follow me\n\n```\nsudo apt install wget htop -y\n```\nThese packages are preinstalled but in some cases, these packages are not been installed so we will be making sure that it's installed.\n\n### Script installation\nThis script will not affect your network connection but if it did then I will leave a tutorial at the end of installation ([Wi-Fi setup](#wi-fi-setup)). Clear your terminal by using the `clear` command it will clear your terminal so that you can see it easily. Now past this script into the terminal so that installation start's\n\n```\nwget https://github.com/OpenMediaVault-Plugin-Developers/installScript/raw/master/install\nchmod +x install\nsudo ./install -n\n```\nSit back and relax until the process is been done till that time go ahead and give me a cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) so that I can bring up various kinds of this topic so that you can enjoy it\n\n![Install complate](/images/posts/nas-installation-complete.png)\nCongratulation it's been installed completed for our protection we will reboot our system with the following command `sudo reboot`.\n\n\n## Step 3 NAS setup on browser\nAs in [Step 2 Software setup](#step-2-software-setup) we have installed once again we will be login into ssh account to check the IP address of our Pi use the following command to check the IP address\n```\nhostname -I\n```\n![Finding IP address](/images/posts/hostname.png)\nAfter finding your IP address use that IP address and open it in the browser with `https://your_ip_address` and it will grant you this page\n\n![OpenMediaVault](/images/posts/openmediavault.png)\nNow now don't be frightened of the login page because you don't know the password and username well of course I also don't know. Just joking type the following and it will let you in\n\n```txt\nusername: admin\npassword: openmediavault\n```\nCongratulation you have successfully login, now before doing anything we will go ahead and change the password you will grant with this screen\n\n![Admin Panel](/images/posts/omv-admin.png)\n\n### Changing admin panel password\nGo to **System** >> **General Settings** >> Click on **Web Administrator Password** then enter your new password after doing that we will plug in any kind of hard drive or some sort of memory storing device\n![Password Change](/images/posts/omv-password-change.png)\n\n### Storage setup\nAs we have inserted external storage head over to **Storage** >> **Disk** and there you will be able to see your storage mounted on pi in my case I have inserted 128GB of memory card for the testing purpose also I have a few files copied into it\n\n![Disk](/images/posts/omv-disk.png)\n\nSelect the disk and then click on Wipe\n\n![Disk Wipe](/images/posts/omv-disk-wipe.png)\n\n![Disk Wipe]\n\nAs we have confirmed that our storage is been mounted on our pi now we will make a shared folder so that we can access it from any device.\n\n![Storage Delete](/images/posts/omv-storage-delete.png)\n\nNow select the quick option\n\n![Storage Delete](/images/posts/omv-storage-delete-1.png)\n\n\n### File System setup\n\nAfter wiping the data from the drive click on `File System` in the `Storage` section. Click on Add button and select `Device` and select the device and give it a label of your choice I will be giving it the name DataCenter, and make sure that you select `EXT4` in `File System`.\n\n![Adding Device](/images/posts/omv-adding-device.png)\n\nAfter hitting Yes to add device take a cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) and wait for it\n\n![Adding Device Complete](/images/posts/omv-adding-device-complete.png)\n\nSelect your device and click on the mount option to mount your device. A pop-up has been visible on the top just hit on the `Apply` button to apply changes so that to make sure that what are we going to make changes will work properly. It will take a few minutes to complete the process.\n\n### Sharing Folder setup\n![Folder Sharing](/images/posts/omv-folder-setup.png)\nNow we will head to `Sharing Folder Setup` to set up our sharing folder. Go to `Access Rights Management` > `Shared Folders`  when you will go there you will find it empty because we haven't set up any sharing folder go ahead and hit that `Add` button without any thoughts.\n![Folder Sharing Setup](/images/posts/omv-folder-setup-1.png)\n\nFill in all the details according to your need and make sure to leave `Permission` as it is until and unless you know the purpose of it. I will be labeling it as DataCenter if you want to comment on that device then you can otherwise Save it, again you will see Apply button on the top right side of the screen as shown in the image below it will take a while to apply the changes.\n\n![Folder Sharing Setup](/images/posts/omv-folder-setup-2.png)\n\nWe will permit it so that we can `Read/Write` files into it. Select your newly created folder and click `Privileges` and give `Read/Write` to both pi users. Hit save and apply.\n\n### Services Setup\n\nGo to the **Services** section and select `SMB/CIFS` as soon as you select it you will be granted a screen with soo many scary options but don't worry we will be using only 2 options only. So go ahead and click sharing in the `SMB/CIFS` section.\n\n![Samba Service](/images/posts/omv-service-smb-page.png)\n\n![Samba Service](/images/posts/omv-services-smb-share.png)\n\nGo ahead click on the `Add` button select your shared folder which you have been created. Hit save and apply don't change any other kind of options if your expert then only does it or else let it be as it is. Go back to the `SMB/CIFS` setting page and enable it. Hit save and apply. Take a cup of [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh) and relax for a bit because we are coming to the most intrusting part which is accessing it from our devices.\n\n\n## Accessing our NAS\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gwM9RaemCvE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nBefore we move on `Windows User` please see the above video to enable `SMB`, as I'm on Ubuntu I can directly access it\n\n![NAS Test](/images/posts/omv-nas-folder.png)\n![NAS Test](/images/posts/omv-nas-auth.png)\nIf you try to access it, it will as you for authentication so use your pi account and password which you used while setting up os if it fails then go to `Access Rights Management` > `User`, select pi user, and edit it after that add your new password and save it. go back to the folder and try to login back and you will be successfully logged in to NAS Folder\n\n![NAS Folder Access](/images/posts/omv-nas-folder-access.png)\n\n##  Wi-Fi Setup\nIf you're going to use Wi-Fi then connect to a monitor and attach a keyboard then simply type the following command in the terminal to access the raspberry pi configuration setup\n\n```\nsudo raspi-config\n# it will represent you with the screen bellow\n```\n![Wifi Setup](/images/posts/raspberrypi-wifi-setup.png)\n\nSelect `System Options` > `Wireless LAN` > Enter your Wi-Fi Name > Enter your Wi-Fi password\n![Wifi Setup](/images/posts/raspberrypi-wifi-setup-1.png)\n![Wifi Setup](/images/posts/raspberrypi-wifi-setup-2.png)\n![Wifi Setup](/images/posts/raspberrypi-wifi-setup-3.png)\n\nAfter completing all the above steps reboot your system with `sudo reboot` and bam done.\n\n\n## Mr. Blogger\n\n### Podcast\n\n<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/show/6p14uYsO8NtWD8tM3wEd4o\" width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n\n### Social Media\n\n- Instagram - [https://instagram.com/mistrysiddh](https://instagram.com/mistrysiddh)\n- Github - [https://guthub.com/mrfoxie](https://guthub.com/mrfoxie)\n- Linkedin - [https://www.linkedin.com/in/SiddhMistry/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/SiddhMistry/)\n- Whatsapp - [Message Me](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=916355040470&text=http%3A%2F%2Fmistrysiddh.tk%2F)\n- Discord - [https://discord.gg/bPrBSbQ2W4](https://discord.gg/bPrBSbQ2W4)\n\n### Donation\n\n- Paypal - [https://paypal.me/mistrysiddh](https://paypal.me/mistrysiddh)\n- Patreon - [https://www.patreon.com/siddhmistry](https://www.patreon.com/siddhmistry)\n- Buymeacoffee - [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh)\n\n### Play Store\n\n[![Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png)](https://bit.ly/2Vch9gi)\n\n","slug":"Raspberry-pi-NAS-System","published":1,"updated":"2025-01-10T03:40:13.644Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cm5uu6j6h001it3yr1h7l518x","content":"<p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Jc4Y2jA4Yeg/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"PI NAS\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Overview\"><a href=\"#Overview\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Overview\"></a>Overview</h2><p>We will be seeing a fully functional NAS server on Raspberry Pi(all pi version) homemade with simple few lines of command and with one software require before we start we will be requiring a few things before we start.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Requirments\"><a href=\"#Requirments\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Requirments\"></a>Requirments</h2><ul>\n<li>Laptop or Desktop</li>\n<li>Stable internet connection(Mobile or Router no matter which connection is it)</li>\n<li>Raspberry Pi with 4GB+ ram (mine is Raspberry Pi 4 B+ model with 8GB of ram)</li>\n<li>MicroSD card with a minimum of 8GB size</li>\n<li>Power supply (power bank or cell phone adaptor)</li>\n<li>MicroB to HDMI with monitor(optional) if you’re going to use a monitor then you will be needing of keyboard</li>\n<li>And most important thing a cup of <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mistrysiddh\">coffee</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Step-1-Hardware-setup\"><a href=\"#Step-1-Hardware-setup\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Step 1 Hardware setup\"></a>Step 1 Hardware setup</h2><p>Ok first of all we need some software which will help us to flash memory card so that we can install os in the memory card to boot in pi. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/raspberry-pi.png\" alt=\"Raspberry pi software\"></p>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/\">https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/</a> and download software according to your OS I’m using Zorin OS which is based on Ubuntu so I will be using the terminal.

As you have seen in the movie such as I robot, wall-e, Transformer etc. where robots are been there. As time passes technology also evolves not also that it gets smatter and smatter also. \n\n### What is a Robot?\n![Robotic Arm](/images/posts/robotic-arm.jpg)\nA robot is the product of the robotics field, where programmable machines are built that can assist humans or mimic human actions. Robots were originally built to handle monotonous tasks (like building cars on an assembly line), but have since expanded well beyond their initial uses to perform tasks like fighting fires, cleaning homes and assisting with incredibly intricate surgeries. Each robot has a differing level of autonomy, ranging from human-controlled bots that carry out tasks that a human has full control over to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any external influences.\n\n### Characteristics\n![Robot Characteristics](/images/posts/robot.jpg)\n1. Robots all consist of some sort of mechanical construction. The mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it’s designed. For example, the Mars 2020 Rover’s wheels are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh terrain of the red planet.\n2. Robots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current (a battery, for example) is needed to power a large majority of robots.\n3. Robots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to carry out a task.\n\nRobots all consist of some sort of mechanical construction.

Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to carry out a task.\n\n### Utilization of Robotics\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Robotics, 1.3 million industrial robots will be in use by 2018. Robotics continues to emerge as a large and influential market.\n\nThe following five industries are utilizing this new technology to boost efficiency and convenience for both businesses and consumers.\n\n#### 1. Health Care\n![Surgical Robot](/images/posts/surgical-robot.jpg)\nAdvances in robotics have the potential to change a wide variety of health care practices, such as surgery, rehabilitation, therapy, patient companionship, and everyday activities. Robotic instruments used in health care are not designed to take over the duties of health care professionals, but rather to make their work easier.\n\nThe da Vinci Surgical System, for example, utilizes the hand movements of the operating surgeon to control tiny, precise instruments inside the patient’s body. This allows for minimally invasive procedures in surgeries such as cardiac, colorectal, gynecologic, head and neck, thoracic, and urologic.\n\nFor patients who have suffered strokes or spinal cord injuries, or who are paralyzed, robotic devices such as exoskeletons have the ability to assist and guide them during rehabilitation. In addition, robotic lifting machines can help nurses lift patients who are elderly or immobile. Companion and therapeutic robots such as Paro can also comfort patients with mental health issues with a system of sensors, microphones, and cameras.\n\n#### 2. Agriculture\n![Farm Robots](/images/posts/farm-robots.jpg)\nTo help increase productivity while lowering overall costs, the agriculture industry has been actively working to adopt different forms of robotic technology. Farmers have already been using tractors and harvesters that are self-guided by GPS. Recently, there has been a rise in the experimental use of autonomous systems that automate operations like pruning, thinning, mowing, spraying, and weed removal. Sensor technology is also being utilized to manage pests and diseases that affect crops.\n\n#### 3. Food Preparation\n![Food line robot](/images/posts/food-robots.jpg)\nOne of the more extravagant advancements in robot technology will soon be available in the kitchen. Automated and intelligent robots — such as those invented by Moley Robotics — will be able to prepare and cook hundreds of meals in a home kitchen. This robotic chef will be controlled via a smartphone, and once the controller chooses a recipe and arranges pre-packaged containers of cut and prepared ingredients, the robot will be able to cook the predetermined meal quickly and efficiently. Moley Robotics is also developing a consumer-friendly version of a robot kitchen, which will include a built-in smart dishwasher and refrigerator.\n\n#### 4. Manufacturing\n![Manufacturing](/images/posts/industrial-robot.jpg)\nRobotics are being used in many aspects of manufacturing to help increase productivity and efficiency while lowering production costs. Similar to the health care industry, many robots in manufacturing collaborate with workers to perform repetitive, monotonous, or intricate tasks under the worker’s guidance and control. With these machines, precision is valued more than speed, as is the ability to be reprogrammed for specific tasks of different sizes and complexities. Robotic manufacturing technology is also becoming safer to operate. Cameras, sensors, and automatic shut-off capabilities enable robots to sense and stay clear of humans in the workplace.\n\n#### 5. Military\n![Army Ground Robot](/images/posts/ArmyGroundRobot.jpg)\nIn the military and public safety sectors, robotic technology is being applied in many areas. One highly visible area involves unmanned drones. These machines can be used for surveillance and support operations on the battlefield. Military drones flying over areas of war and conflict, in hostage situations, and for natural and manmade disasters are able to assess danger levels and provide soldiers and first responders with real-time information. Drones are revolutionizing disaster response since they can access hazardous areas with greater speed and precision without placing human responders in harm’s way.\n\nRobotic devices are already establishing a wide presence in several commercial industries. As robotic technologies become more affordable, they will soon be available in various forms for consumers as well, with the ability to impact our lives in countless ways.\n\n### Pros && Cons\n\n#### Pros\n1. The first and the foremost advantage of having robots in workplaces is their cost. Robots are much cheaper than humans and their cost is now decreasing.\n\n2. It’s a fact that we cannot compare human abilities with robots but robotic capabilities are now growing quickly. For example, if you run an essay writing service, you can use robots to perform every kind of research related to any subject.\n\n3. Because robots are more active and don’t get tired like humans, the collaboration between humans and robots is reducing absenteeism. The pace of human cannot increase hence robots are helping humans.\n\n4. Robots are more precise than humans; they don’t tremble or shake as human hands. Robots have smaller and versatile moving parts which help them in performing tasks with more accuracy than humans.\n\n5. There is no doubt that robots are significantly stronger and faster than humans.\n\n6. Robots come in any shape and size, depending upon the need of the task.\n\n7. Robots can work anywhere in any environmental condition whether it is space, underwater, in extreme heat or wind etc. Robots can be used everywhere where human safety is a huge concern.\n\n8. Robots are programmed by a human; they cannot say no to anything and can be used for any dangerous and unwanted work where humans may deny to offer their services. For example, many robotic probes have been sent into space but have never returned.\n\n9. Robots in warfare are saving more lives and have now proven to be very successful.\n\n10. Robots are now being used in the chemical industry and can, for example deal with chemical spills in a nuclear plant, which would otherwise pose a major health concern.\n\n11. The best thing about robots is that they never get tired and can literally work on certain tasks 24 x 7. The human brain gets tired if it’s working continuously but robots never get tired of what they are programmed to do and they can work on certain tasks error free.\n\n#### Cons\n\n1. Where robots are increasing the efficiency in many businesses, they are also increasing the unemployment rate. Because of robots, human labour is no longer required in many factories and manufacturing plants.\n\n2. Robots can certainly handle their prescribed tasks, but they typically cannot handle unexpected situations.\n\n3. The ROI of your business may suffer if your operation relies on too many robots. They have higher expenses than humans, so at the end of the day you may not always achieve the desired ROI.\n\n4. Robots may have AI but they are certainly not as intelligent as humans. They can never improve their jobs outside the pre-defined programming because they simply cannot think for themselves.\n\n5. Robots installed in workplaces still require manual labour attached to them. Training those employees on how to work with the robots definitely has a cost attached to it.\n\n6. Robots have no sense of emotions or conscience. They lack empathy and this is one major disadvantage of having an emotionless workplace.\n\n7. Robots operate on the basis of information fed to them through a chip. If one thing goes wrong the entire company bears the loss.\n\nWhere a robot saves times, on the other hand it can also result in a lag. It is, after all, a machine so you cannot expect too much from them. If a robot malfunctions, you need extra time to fix it, which would require reprogramming.\n\nIf ultimately robots would do all the work, and the humans will just sit and monitor them, health hazards will increase rapidly. Obesity will be on top of the list.\n\nSo there are advantages, but there are disadvantages as well. It is the twenty first century and we cannot work without machines.\n\nHumans are still considered far more efficient than robots when it comes to decision making powers, handling difficult situations, brainstorming, and generally bringing a sense of emotion and empathy into a workplace.\n","source":"_posts/Robotics.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Robotics\"\ndate: 2021-04-13 15:02:14\ndescription: \"Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that substitute for (or replicate) human actions.

[Softaculous](https://remote.softaculous.com/) is a software which is been used by hosting provider to install different types of forums, blog, portal/CMS, wikis, mail, e-commerce, frameworks etc.\n\n![Softaculous](/images/posts/softaculous.png)**Softaculous script install panel**\n\n### Pros & Cons\n Pros | Cons\n------|---------\nAbility to add or edit pages on your website yourself. | Potential to break your websites look and feel if not used properly.\nNot have to pay your developer monthly maintenance or hourly rate for changes. | You may not have the resource to update website regularly\nUseful in organisations, with many content contributors, that perhaps need to audit additions and changes to content being made. | Using a CSM effectively can require certain computer skills that you or your staff may not have.\n\n\n## What is headless CMS?\n\n![Headless CMS](/images/posts/headless-cms.jpg)\n\nA headless content management system, or headless CMS, is a back-end only content management system built from the ground up as a content repository that makes content accessible via an API for display on any device. The term “headless” comes from the concept of chopping the “head” off the “body”.\n\n### What does headless CMS mean?\n\nIt’s like a shop with no front window. There are customers inside and cashiers processing orders but you can’t see that from the outside. That’s how a headless CMS works. It's a traditional CMS (such as Drupal or Wordpress) without a frontend. The page designs are built using a frontend framework and the data from these headless CMS systems is exposed so that the frontend can grab the data and use it there instead.\n\n### Why are headless CMS used?\n\nBecause they’re really fast. \nAnd there is normally an interface already available to the developers and users to extend and use. For example, WordPress ships with its own admin panel, article writing section and user management amongst a plethora of other useful tools. This saves both time and money and lots of individuals in this space are already accustomed to using well-known CMS’. Most of the focus will be on creating a polished experience for your customers and some time spent on extending the CMS’ functionality for any purpose needed. Also, organisations gain immense levels of flexibility by having the option to take their amazing frontend and choose to use another backend in the future if needed. \n\n### What are the benefits of a headless CMS?\n\nIf you have a website built purely with a CMS, every request has to load all of the assets of every page you visit. You can alleviate some of the strain on your server by optimising images, caching CSS and JavaScript and making some additional server changes but it is unlikely to be as good an experience or as fast as a Single Page Application.\n\nBy using a frontend framework like React or Vue, the application doesn’t have to load any structural assets after initially loading. Any data which shows on a page within the frontend will come through via a request or a bunch of requests made to the endpoints on offer from the headless CMS. And you can usually add additional endpoints for extra data or alternative functionality. There may be a business requirement in the future where you need to move to another backend for efficiency or for some other reason:\n\nYou could have the new CMS send out the same Application Programming Interface (API) endpoints as the current system and your frontend will still work the same as it did before albeit perhaps a bit faster depending on what was done. \nFor instance, you may have wanted a custom CMS created with a React-powered backend interface which makes changes to a database hosted with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Other benefits include being able to reduce your server costs as headless CMS application’s tend to scale better with lots of traffic.\n\nHeadless CMS Benefits | Explanation\n----------------------|-------------\nOmnichannel Content Delivery | Headless CMS can power touchpoints across any channel or device. From websites to mobile apps, email marketing, voice-activated digital assistants, Apple Watch, AR/VR, and more. Content lives in a cloud-first content hub, and deployment is simple — nothing to install or manage.\nRapid Content Deployment (via API) | A headless CMS like Contentstack offers an API-first approach that makes it lightning-fast for developers to pipe in content. Using our Content-as-a-Service (CaaS) architecture, you can quickly scale or deploy new channels in an afternoon.\nModular Content and Assets | Because the content that lives in your headless CMS isn’t dependent on any specific front-end display, content becomes modular; it can be managed and deployed across any relevant touchpoint without being duplicated or reformatted.\nLimitless Integrations that Power Next-Level Digital Experiences | The headless CMS allows you to connect content to a nearly infinite array of outside services and software. Your content is no longer siloed from systems like CRM, AI/ML, personalization tools, or localization platforms.","source":"_posts/Transfer_Site.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Changing Site\"\ndate: 2020-12-12 16:04:51\ndescription: What is the reason of changing me site from wordpress to headless cms?\ndraft: false\nhideToc: false\nenableToc: true\nenableTocContent: false\nauthor: Siddh Mistry\nauthorEmoji: 🤯\nurl: /blogger-to-hugo/\npinned: false\ntags:\n- new site \nseries:\n- website\ncategories:\n- website\ncover: images/posts/transfer.png\n---\n\n## What is Wordpress?\n\nWordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database.

Its primary goals are to increase file system performance, as well as adding full system call compatibility.\n\nThis new architecture changes how these Linux binaries interact with Windows and your computer's hardware, but still provides the same user experience as in WSL 1 (the current widely available version).\n\nIndividual Linux distributions can be run with either the WSL 1 or WSL 2 architecture. Each distribution can be upgraded or downgraded at any time and you can run WSL 1 and WSL 2 distributions side by side. WSL 2 uses an entirely new architecture that benefits from running a real Linux kernel. Let's see the comparison between ` WSL 1 ` and ` WSL 2 `\n\n## Comparing WSL 1 and WSL 2\nThe primary difference and reasons for updating the Windows Subsystem for Linux from WSL 1 to WSL 2 are to:\n\n  - increase file system performance,\n  - support full system call compatibility.\n    WSL 2 uses the latest and greatest in virtualization technology to run a Linux kernel inside of a lightweight utility virtual machine (VM). However, WSL 2 is not a traditional VM experience.\n\n### Comparing features\n\n| Feature                                                      | WSL 1 | WSL 2 |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- | ----- |\n| Integration between Windows and Linux                        | ✅     | ✅     |\n| Fast boot times                                              | ✅     | ✅     |\n| Small resource foot print compared to traditional Virtual Machines | ✅     | ✅     |\n| Runs with current versions of VMware and VirtualBox          | ✅     | ✅     |\n| Managed VM                                                   | ❌     | ✅     |\n| Full Linux Kernel                                            | ❌     | ✅     |\n| Full system call compatibility                               | ❌     | ✅     |\n| Performance across OS file systems                           | ✅     | ❌     |\n\n## Performance across OS file systems\n\nWe recommend against working across operating systems with your files, unless you have a specific reason for doing so. For the fastest performance speed, store your files in the WSL file system if you are working in a Linux command line (Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, etc). If you're working in a Windows command line (PowerShell, Command Prompt), store your files in the Windows file system.\n\nFor example, when storing your WSL project files:\n\n- Use the Linux file system root directory: `\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-18.04\\home\\<user name>\\Project`\n- Not the Windows file system root directory: `C:\\Users\\<user name>\\Project`\n\nAll currently running distributions (`wsl -l`) are accessible via network connection. To get there run a command [WIN+R] (keyboard shortcut) or type in File Explorer address bar `\\\\wsl$` to find respective distribution names and access their root file systems.\n\nYou can also use windows commands inside WSL's Linux [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_console). Try opening a Linux distribution (ie Ubuntu), be sure that you are in the Linux home directory by entering this command: `cd ~`. Then open your Linux file system in File Explorer by entering *(don't forget the period at the end)*: `powershell.exe /c start .`\n\nWSL 2 is only available in Windows 10, Version 1903, Build 18362 or higher. Check your Windows version by selecting the **Windows logo key + R**, type **winver**, select **OK**. (Or enter the `ver` command in Windows Command Prompt). You may need to [update to the latest Windows version](ms-settings:windowsupdate). For builds lower than 18362, WSL is not supported at all.\n\n## Installation of WSL 2\n\nThere are two options available for installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):\n\n- **[Simplified install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#simplified-installation-for-windows-insiders)** *(preview release)*: `wsl --install`\n\n  The `wsl --install` simplified install command requires that you join the [Windows Insiders Program](https://insider.windows.com/getting-started) and install a preview build of Windows 10 (OS build 20262 or higher), but eliminates the need to follow the manual install steps. All you need to do is open a command window with administrator privileges and run `wsl --install`, after a restart you will be ready to use WSL.\n\n### Manual Installation Steps\n\nIf you are not on a Windows Insiders build, the features required for WSL will need to be enabled manually following the steps below.\n\n- #### Step 1 - Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux\n\nYou must first enable the \"Windows Subsystem for Linux\" optional feature before installing any Linux distributions on Windows.\n\nOpen PowerShell as Administrator and run:\n\n```powershell\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart\n```\n\n- #### Step 2 - Check requirements for running WSL 2\n\nTo update to WSL 2, you must be running Windows 10.\n\n- For x64 systems: **Version 1903** or higher, with **Build 18362** or higher.\n- For ARM64 systems: **Version 2004** or higher, with **Build 19041** or higher.\n- Builds lower than 18362 do not support WSL 2. Use the [Windows Update Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10) to update your version of Windows.\n\nIf you are running Windows 10 version 1903 or 1909, open \"Settings\" from your Windows menu, navigate to \"Update & Security\" and select \"Check for Updates\". Your Build number must be 18362.1049+ or 18363.1049+, with the minor build # over .1049. Read more: [WSL 2 Support is coming to Windows 10 Versions 1903 and 1909](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-support-is-coming-to-windows-10-versions-1903-and-1909/). See the [troubleshooting instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#im-on-windows-10-version-1903-and-i-still-do-not-see-options-for-wsl-2).\n\n- ### Step 3 - Enable Virtual Machine feature\n\nBefore installing WSL 2, you must enable the **Virtual Machine Platform** optional feature. Your machine will require [virtualization capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#error-0x80370102-the-virtual-machine-could-not-be-started-because-a-required-feature-is-not-installed) to use this feature.\n\nOpen PowerShell as Administrator and run:\n\n```powershell\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart\n```\n\n**Restart** your machine to complete the WSL install and update to WSL 2.\n\n- ### Step 4 - Download the Linux kernel update package\n\nDownload the latest package:\n\n- [WSL2 Linux kernel update package for x64 machines](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi)\n\nIf you're using an ARM64 machine, please download the [ARM64 package](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_arm64.msi) instead. If you're not sure what kind of machine you have, open Command Prompt or PowerShell and enter: `systeminfo | find \"System Type\"`. **Caveat:** On non-English Windows versions, you might have to modify the search text, for example, in German it would be `systeminfo | find \"Systemtyp\"`.\n\n- Run the update package downloaded in the previous step. (Double-click to run - you will be prompted for elevated permissions, select ‘yes’ to approve this installation.)\n\n- #### Step 5 - Set WSL 2 as your default version\n\nOpen PowerShell and run this command to set WSL 2 as the default version when installing a new Linux distribution:\n\n```powershell\nwsl --set-default-version 2\n```\n\n- ####  Step 6 - Install your Linux distribution of choice\n\n1. manual installation\n\nIf you are on ` Windows 10 Insider Preview build 21362+ ` then just type the following commands in powershell\n\n```powershell\n#this command will show you list of all distribution which is been supported by windows\nwsl --list --online\n```\n\nas soon as paste the above command you will get this message there\n\n```\nPS C:\\Users\\SIDDH> wsl --list --online\nThe following is a list of valid distributions that can be installed.\nInstall using 'wsl --install -d <Distro>'.\n\nNAME            FRIENDLY NAME\nUbuntu          Ubuntu\nDebian          Debian GNU/Linux\nkali-linux      Kali Linux Rolling\nopenSUSE-42     openSUSE Leap 42\nSLES-12         SUSE Linux Enterprise Server v12\nUbuntu-16.04    Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\nUbuntu-18.04    Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\nUbuntu-20.04    Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\n```\n\nyou can choose any of the distro you want to install in your system say for example if you want to install Ubuntu then just past the following command\n\n```powershell\nwsl --install -d ubuntu\n```\n\nand it will start installing into your system after completion it will ask you for a username and password set those two parameters and you will be able to use Ubuntu in your system without dual-boot\n\n![Ubuntu Install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/media/ubuntuinstall.png)\n\n2. Open the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/wslstore) and select your favorite Linux distribution.\n\n![Microsoft Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/media/store.png)\n\nThe following links will open the Microsoft store page for each distribution:\n\n- [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N9TNGVNDL3Q)\n- [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9n6svws3rx71)\n- [openSUSE Leap 15.1](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NJFZK00FGKV)\n- [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9MZ3D1TRP8T1)\n- [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PN498VPMF3Z)\n- [Kali Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PKR34TNCV07)\n- [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9MSVKQC78PK6)\n- [Fedora Remix for WSL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9n6gdm4k2hnc)\n- [Pengwin](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NV1GV1PXZ6P)\n- [Pengwin Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N8LP0X93VCP)\n- [Alpine WSL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9p804crf0395)\n\n- #### Install Windows Terminal (optional)\n\nWindows Terminal enables multiple tabs (quickly switch between multiple Linux command lines, Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, Azure CLI, etc), create custom key bindings (shortcut keys for opening or closing tabs, copy+paste, etc.), use the search feature, and custom themes (color schemes, font styles and sizes, background image/blur/transparency).\n\n[Install Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/get-started).\n\n![Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/media/terminal.png)\n\nNow you can use linux as well as windows at a same time.

However, WSL 2 is not a traditional VM experience.\n\n### Comparing features\n\n| Feature                                                      | WSL 1 | WSL 2 |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- | ----- |\n| Integration between Windows and Linux                        | ✅     | ✅     |\n| Fast boot times                                              | ✅     | ✅     |\n| Small resource foot print compared to traditional Virtual Machines | ✅     | ✅     |\n| Runs with current versions of VMware and VirtualBox          | ✅     | ✅     |\n| Managed VM                                                   | ❌     | ✅     |\n| Full Linux Kernel                                            | ❌     | ✅     |\n| Full system call compatibility                               | ❌     | ✅     |\n| Performance across OS file systems                           | ✅     | ❌     |\n\n## Performance across OS file systems\n\nWe recommend against working across operating systems with your files, unless you have a specific reason for doing so. For the fastest performance speed, store your files in the WSL file system if you are working in a Linux command line (Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, etc). If you're working in a Windows command line (PowerShell, Command Prompt), store your files in the Windows file system.\n\nFor example, when storing your WSL project files:\n\n- Use the Linux file system root directory: `\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-18.04\\home\\<user name>\\Project`\n- Not the Windows file system root directory: `C:\\Users\\<user name>\\Project`\n\nAll currently running distributions (`wsl -l`) are accessible via network connection. To get there run a command [WIN+R] (keyboard shortcut) or type in File Explorer address bar `\\\\wsl$` to find respective distribution names and access their root file systems.\n\nYou can also use windows commands inside WSL's Linux [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_console). Try opening a Linux distribution (ie Ubuntu), be sure that you are in the Linux home directory by entering this command: `cd ~`. Then open your Linux file system in File Explorer by entering *(don't forget the period at the end)*: `powershell.exe /c start .`\n\nWSL 2 is only available in Windows 10, Version 1903, Build 18362 or higher. Check your Windows version by selecting the **Windows logo key + R**, type **winver**, select **OK**. (Or enter the `ver` command in Windows Command Prompt). You may need to [update to the latest Windows version](ms-settings:windowsupdate). For builds lower than 18362, WSL is not supported at all.\n\n## Installation of WSL 2\n\nThere are two options available for installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):\n\n- **[Simplified install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#simplified-installation-for-windows-insiders)** *(preview release)*: `wsl --install`\n\n  The `wsl --install` simplified install command requires that you join the [Windows Insiders Program](https://insider.windows.com/getting-started) and install a preview build of Windows 10 (OS build 20262 or higher), but eliminates the need to follow the manual install steps. All you need to do is open a command window with administrator privileges and run `wsl --install`, after a restart you will be ready to use WSL.\n\n### Manual Installation Steps\n\nIf you are not on a Windows Insiders build, the features required for WSL will need to be enabled manually following the steps below.\n\n- #### Step 1 - Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux\n\nYou must first enable the \"Windows Subsystem for Linux\" optional feature before installing any Linux distributions on Windows.\n\nOpen PowerShell as Administrator and run:\n\n```powershell\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart\n```\n\n- #### Step 2 - Check requirements for running WSL 2\n\nTo update to WSL 2, you must be running Windows 10.\n\n- For x64 systems: **Version 1903** or higher, with **Build 18362** or higher.\n- For ARM64 systems: **Version 2004** or higher, with **Build 19041** or higher.\n- Builds lower than 18362 do not support WSL 2. Use the [Windows Update Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10) to update your version of Windows.\n\nIf you are running Windows 10 version 1903 or 1909, open \"Settings\" from your Windows menu, navigate to \"Update & Security\" and select \"Check for Updates\". Your Build number must be 18362.1049+ or 18363.1049+, with the minor build # over .1049.

See the [troubleshooting instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#im-on-windows-10-version-1903-and-i-still-do-not-see-options-for-wsl-2).\n\n- ### Step 3 - Enable Virtual Machine feature\n\nBefore installing WSL 2, you must enable the **Virtual Machine Platform** optional feature. Your machine will require [virtualization capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#error-0x80370102-the-virtual-machine-could-not-be-started-because-a-required-feature-is-not-installed) to use this feature.\n\nOpen PowerShell as Administrator and run:\n\n```powershell\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart\n```\n\n**Restart** your machine to complete the WSL install and update to WSL 2.\n\n- ### Step 4 - Download the Linux kernel update package\n\nDownload the latest package:\n\n- [WSL2 Linux kernel update package for x64 machines](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi)\n\nIf you're using an ARM64 machine, please download the [ARM64 package](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_arm64.msi) instead. If you're not sure what kind of machine you have, open Command Prompt or PowerShell and enter: `systeminfo | find \"System Type\"`. **Caveat:** On non-English Windows versions, you might have to modify the search text, for example, in German it would be `systeminfo | find \"Systemtyp\"`.\n\n- Run the update package downloaded in the previous step. (Double-click to run - you will be prompted for elevated permissions, select ‘yes’ to approve this installation.)\n\n- #### Step 5 - Set WSL 2 as your default version\n\nOpen PowerShell and run this command to set WSL 2 as the default version when installing a new Linux distribution:\n\n```powershell\nwsl --set-default-version 2\n```\n\n- ####  Step 6 - Install your Linux distribution of choice\n\n1. manual installation\n\nIf you are on ` Windows 10 Insider Preview build 21362+ ` then just type the following commands in powershell\n\n```powershell\n#this command will show you list of all distribution which is been supported by windows\nwsl --list --online\n```\n\nas soon as paste the above command you will get this message there\n\n```\nPS C:\\Users\\SIDDH> wsl --list --online\nThe following is a list of valid distributions that can be installed.\nInstall using 'wsl --install -d <Distro>'.\n\nNAME            FRIENDLY NAME\nUbuntu          Ubuntu\nDebian          Debian GNU/Linux\nkali-linux      Kali Linux Rolling\nopenSUSE-42     openSUSE Leap 42\nSLES-12         SUSE Linux Enterprise Server v12\nUbuntu-16.04    Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\nUbuntu-18.04    Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\nUbuntu-20.04    Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\n```\n\nyou can choose any of the distro you want to install in your system say for example if you want to install Ubuntu then just past the following command\n\n```powershell\nwsl --install -d ubuntu\n```\n\nand it will start installing into your system after completion it will ask you for a username and password set those two parameters and you will be able to use Ubuntu in your system without dual-boot\n\n![Ubuntu Install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/media/ubuntuinstall.png)\n\n2. Open the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/wslstore) and select your favorite Linux distribution.\n\n![Microsoft Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/media/store.png)\n\nThe following links will open the Microsoft store page for each distribution:\n\n- [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N9TNGVNDL3Q)\n- [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9n6svws3rx71)\n- [openSUSE Leap 15.1](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NJFZK00FGKV)\n- [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9MZ3D1TRP8T1)\n- [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PN498VPMF3Z)\n- [Kali Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PKR34TNCV07)\n- [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9MSVKQC78PK6)\n- [Fedora Remix for WSL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9n6gdm4k2hnc)\n- [Pengwin](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NV1GV1PXZ6P)\n- [Pengwin Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N8LP0X93VCP)\n- [Alpine WSL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9p804crf0395)\n\n- #### Install Windows Terminal (optional)\n\nWindows Terminal enables multiple tabs (quickly switch between multiple Linux command lines, Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, Azure CLI, etc), create custom key bindings (shortcut keys for opening or closing tabs, copy+paste, etc.), use the search feature, and custom themes (color schemes, font styles and sizes, background image/blur/transparency).\n\n[Install Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/get-started).\n\n![Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/media/terminal.png)\n\nNow you can use linux as well as windows at a same time.

Each distribution can be upgraded or downgraded at any time and you can run WSL 1 and WSL 2 distributions side by side.

If you’re working in a Windows command line (PowerShell, Command Prompt), store your files in the Windows file system.</p>\n<p>For example, when storing your WSL project files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the Linux file system root directory: <code>\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-18.04\\home\\&lt;user name&gt;\\Project</code></li>\n<li>Not the Windows file system root directory: <code>C:\\Users\\&lt;user name&gt;\\Project</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All currently running distributions (<code>wsl -l</code>) are accessible via network connection.

While users can accomplish this today using a multiple system setup, with individual PC dedicated to Windows and Linux, virtual machine hosting either Windows or Linux, or an XServer running on Windows and projected into WSL, WSLg provides a more integrated, user friendly and productive alternative.\n\nWSLg strives to make Linux GUI applications feel native and natural to use on Windows. From integration into the Start Menu for launch to appearing in the task bar, alt-tab experience to enabling cut/paste across Windows and Linux applications, WSLg enables a seamless desktop experience and workflow leveraging Windows and Linux applications.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Pre-requirements\n\nBefore you begin installation of WSLG you have to check few thing on your system so that there is no error while installation. Here are the requirements:\n\n- [x] `Windows 10 Insider Preview build 21362+` (required for now but in future it will be available for normal builds if you aren't on this build then go to setup [Windows Insider](https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/wsl2install/#installation-of-wsl-2) and get latest versions of Insider Preview build)\n- [x] Choose your GPU (if you have already install drivers then you can skip this steps)\n  - [x] [AMD GPU driver for WSL](https://community.amd.com/community/radeon-pro-graphics/blog/2020/06/17/announcing-amd-support-for-gpu-accelerated-machine-learning-training-on-windows-10)\n  - [x] [Intel GPU driver for WSL](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/29526)\n  - [x] [NVIDIA GPU driver for WSL](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl) (I have NVIDIA GeForce on my device so I have already installed it)\n\n### Install instructions\n\nI assume that you have installed WSL on your system but if you haven't installed it yet then go to [WSL2 Installation](https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/ws2install/) and install it. Moving further If you have an existing WSL installation without WSLg and want to update to the latest version of WSL which includes WSLg, run the command `wsl --update` from an elevated command prompt, and also download and install [Linux GUI support](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/releases/tag/v1.0.24) on your system so that the software requirement to run WSLg will be installed automatically. \n\nPlease note that WSLg is only compatible with WSL 2 and will not work for WSL distribution configured to work in WSL 1 mode. Verify that your Linux distro is configured for running in WSL 2 mode, if not switch to WSL 2. While you can continue to run Linux distro in WSL 1 mode after installing WSLg if you so desired, a distro configured to run in WSL 1 mode will not be able to communicate with WSLg and will not be able to run GUI applications.\n\nYou can list your currently installed distro and the version of WSL they are configured for using the following command from an elevated command prompt.\n\n```powershell\n   wsl --list -v\n```\n\nIf running in version 1 mode, switch to version 2. This can take a while.\n\n```powershell\n   wsl --set-version _distro_name_ 2\n```\n\nRestart WSL by running this command from an elevated command prompt, make sure to save any pending work first:\n\n```powershell\n    wsl --shutdown\n```\n\n## Updating WSL + WSLg\n\nTo update to the latest version of WSL and WSLg released for preview, simply run `wsl --update` from an elevated command prompt or powershell.\n\nYou'll need to restart WSL for the changes to take effect. You can restart WSL by running `wsl --shutdown` from an elevated command prompt. If WSL was currently running, it will shutdown, make sure to first save any in progress work! WSL will be automatically restarted the next time you launch a WSL application or terminal.\n\n## First Launch\n\nIf you have installed the `Ubuntu` Linux distro per these instructions, you'll find an `Ubuntu` icon in your start menu, launch it. This will launch the WSL 2 VM, launch the Ubuntu WSL distro in that VM and give you a terminal to interact with it. Voila! You're running Linux on Windows!\n\nIf you would like to explore additional Linux distributions built for WSL, you can use the `wsl --list --online` command from an elevated command prompt to enumerate the list of available distributions for your system. You can have multiple Linux distributions installed within WSL and they will happily coexist side-by-side, so don't be scared to experiment and try things out. Now let's install and try some apps\n\n## Install and run GUI apps\n\nIf you want to get started with some GUI apps, you can run the following commands from your Linux terminal to download and install some popular applications. If you are using a different distribution than Ubuntu, it may be using a different package manager.\n\n```\n## Update all packages in your distro\nsudo apt update\n\n## Gedit\nsudo apt install gedit -y\n\n## GIMP\nsudo apt install gimp -y\n\n## Nautilus\nsudo apt install nautilus -y\n\n## VLC\nsudo apt install vlc -y\n\n## X11 apps\nsudo apt install x11-apps -y\n\n## Google Chrome\ncd /tmp\nsudo wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb \nsudo apt install --fix-broken -y\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\n\n## Microsoft Teams\ncd /tmp\nsudo curl -L -o \"./teams.deb\" \"https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads/desktopurl?env=production&plat=linux&arch=x64&download=true&linuxArchiveType=deb\"\nsudo apt install ./teams.deb -y\n\n## Microsoft Edge Browser\nsudo curl https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/edge/pool/main/m/microsoft-edge-dev/microsoft-edge-dev_91.0.852.0-1_amd64.deb -o /tmp/edge.deb\nsudo apt install /tmp/edge.deb -y\n```\n\nOnce these applications are installed, you'll find them in your start menu under the distro name. For example `Ubuntu -> Microsoft Edge`. You can also launch these from your terminal window using the commands:\n\n- `xcalc`, `xclock`, `xeyes`\n- `gimp`\n- `gedit ~/.bashrc`\n- `nautilus`\n- `vlc`\n- `google-chrome`\n- `teams`\n- `microsoft-edge`\n\n**Congrats you are done and ready to use GUI apps!** \n","source":"_posts/WSLG.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"WSL Graphics\"\ndate: 2021-06-19 09:59:27\ndescription: \"WSLg is short for Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI and the purpose of the project is to enable support for running Linux GUI applications (X11 and Wayland) on Windows in a fully integrated desktop experience.\"\ntags:\n- technology\n- wsl\n- wsl2\n- Linux\n- ubuntu\nseries:\n- Hacking\n- Windows\ncategories:\n- technology\ncover: images/posts/WSLg_IntegratedDesktop.png\nfeature: true\n---\n## Recaps\n\nIn previous post we have seen how to install [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/wsl2install) in your windows 10, so in this we will see how to use **GUI** on your system without any kind of software or other utilities.

Moving further If you have an existing WSL installation without WSLg and want to update to the latest version of WSL which includes WSLg, run the command <code>wsl --update</code> from an elevated command prompt, and also download and install <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/releases/tag/v1.0.24\">Linux GUI support</a> on your system so that the software requirement to run WSLg will be installed automatically. </p>\n<p>Please note that WSLg is only compatible with WSL 2 and will not work for WSL distribution configured to work in WSL 1 mode. Verify that your Linux distro is configured for running in WSL 2 mode, if not switch to WSL 2. While you can continue to run Linux distro in WSL 1 mode after installing WSLg if you so desired, a distro configured to run in WSL 1 mode will not be able to communicate with WSLg and will not be able to run GUI applications.</p>\n<p>You can list your currently installed distro and the version of WSL they are configured for using the following command from an elevated command prompt.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight powershell\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">wsl <span class=\"literal\">--list</span> <span class=\"literal\">-v</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n\n<p>If running in version 1 mode, switch to version 2.

Since we started WhatsApp, we’ve built our services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind. In our updated [Terms of Service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy) you’ll find:\n>\n> - **Additional Information On How We Handle Your Data**. Our updated Terms and Privacy Policy provide more information on how we process your data, and our commitment to privacy. For example, we’ve added more information about more recent product features and functionalities, how we process your data for safety, security and integrity, and added more direct links to user settings, Help Center articles and how you can manage your information.\n> - **Better Communication With Businesses**. Many businesses rely on WhatsApp to communicate with their customers and clients. We work with businesses that use Facebook or third parties to help store and better manage their communications with you on WhatsApp.\n> - **Making It Easier To Connect**. As part of the [Facebook Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies), WhatsApp partners with Facebook to offer experiences and integrations across Facebook’s family of apps and products.\n\nWhatsApp suddenly decided that they need to take explicit consent from their users for giving away their metadata and other information to Facebook, with a “take it or leave it” option. WhatsApp is owned by Facebook.\n\nWhat does this mean to the common user? Well, as Facebook has been mentioning, they will use this data to better target their advertisements on the Facebook platform. How can one better target you as a consumer? By getting more information about your preferences, likes, dislikes, your income, your disposable income, how much money you receive, your spending patterns and what kind of information you are consuming in your WhatsApp chats and whatever other information they can lay their hands on through their digital platforms.\n\nNow as the argument goes, if you are not paying for the WhatsApp service, then you have to pay to them through your data, as you are the product that they sell to make money. So, you should be open to your privacy being violated by giving up every information about you, captured from your Facebook posts and captured from your WhatsApp posts. As people tend to have one-on-one chats and often share their deepest secrets over WhatsApp, it would not be surprising if you suddenly start seeing advertisements on your Facebook page that you would normally not expect.\n\nMost people have experienced the case where one has searched for a certain item, say shoes, and have started getting advertisements of shoes on your Facebook page. In fact, many have had the perplexing experience of merely talking about an item, say shirts, and getting advertisements of shirts on their Facebook page. So, imagine, if you are a closet LGBT, except for your chats on WhatsApp, and suddenly you start getting LGBT related content on your Facebook? Or if you are talking about selling your property on WhatsApp, and start getting Wealth Managers targeting you on Facebook.\n\nIt is the end of privacy in the truest sense possible. Nothing about you will be sacrosanct. That may be an acceptable proposition to the large population in India, but that is not acceptable to the world at large, especially from the more advanced economies, as Privacy is linked closely to Dignity of life (which is apparently also enshrined in our Constitution). Hence, globally, there is a mass movement of people taking What’sapp’s ‘Take it or Leave it’ offer literally by quitting it en masse. Others are taking more measured steps, quitting WhatsApp slowly, one group at a time, till they are completely out. And where are they moving to? They are moving to Signal and Telegram for now.\n\nSpooked by this exodus, Facebook came out late in the day to clarify that this consent requirement for data is only for WhatsApp Business and not the regular WhatsApp. However, till the time of writing this article, I had been getting reports of users of WhatsApp getting a pop-up in their regular WhatsApp, asking them to give consent of sharing their data with Facebook, with January 8th being the deadline.\n\nWhat is also perplexing is that the large number of voices that were against Aadhar being rolled out in India and used extensively, due to their belief that it might lead to privacy violation, do not seem to be lending their voices to this gross violation of privacy by WhatsApp. On the face of it, WhatsApp is giving an option – either you accept to part with all your information from WhatsApp to Facebook or you are free to quit WhatsApp.\n\nNow why is this a non-option for many? This is a non-option due to an interesting phenomenon called the Network Effect. The Network effect in essence implies that if everyone else is already part of that network, then the value of that network is extremely high and you cannot afford to leave it. If your business associates and friends are already using WhatsApp, then you will have to pursue each one of them to move to whatever new platform you plan to move to in order to stay connected. That is an almost impossible proposition. And that is the stickiness of an app due to the Network Effect. And that is why many people will still find it difficult to move out of WhatsApp.\n\nSo, shouldn’t the government step in and protect its citizens from this gross violation? In reality, in a rule-based governance system, there is little that the government can do based on the current regulations. The Personal Data Privacy Act essentially says that if you give consent to share your data, then there is nothing illegal that the company is doing and the government cannot do anything about it. If you do not want to give consent to share your data, then you are free to quit WhatsApp. The current regulations do not factor in the Network Effect and hence the unfair trade practices emerging from the Network Effect. This is similar to the big builders getting the gullible customers to sign on large detailed agreements for buying their expensive apartments, where the terms of the agreements are completely one-sided, in favour of the builders. The government did change the regulations under RERA to ensure that the builders cannot dictate such unfair terms to the buyers. It is about time that we extend a similar regulation to the digital world, where digital services that have become a necessity and have become a digital monopoly, cannot impose unfair terms on the citizens of India.","source":"_posts/Whatsapp-is-updating-its-terms-and-privacy-policy.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Whatsapp Is Updating Its Terms and Privacy Policy\ndate: 2021-01-11 18:18:30\ndescription: WhatsApp suddenly decided that they need to take explicit consent\n  from their users for giving away their metadata and other information to\n  Facebook, with a “take it or leave it” option.

They are a group of enthusiasts, rocket scientists, engineers, programmers, lawyers, and more.\n\nFirst we will see little bit of information of 3D printer.\n\n## 3D Printer\n![3D Printer](/images/posts/3d_printer.jpg)\n3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model. The term \"3D printing\" can refer to a variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together (such as plastics, liquids or powder grains being fused together), typically layer by layer.\n\n### What is 3D Printer?\n3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced cross-section of the object. 3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine. 3D printing enables you to produce complex shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods.\n\n### How does 3D Printer works?\n\n3D printing also called additive manufacturing can be thought has creative object using successive addition. 3D printer usually works by printing a layer over a previous printed layer and repeating the task till the objective is completed. Just like 2D printers, 3D printers also come equipped with different techniques to achieve the same task. Each having it's own advantages.

The term \"3D printing\" can refer to a variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together (such as plastics, liquids or powder grains being fused together), typically layer by layer.\n\n### What is 3D Printer?\n3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced cross-section of the object. 3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine. 3D printing enables you to produce complex shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods.\n\n### How does 3D Printer works?\n\n3D printing also called additive manufacturing can be thought has creative object using successive addition. 3D printer usually works by printing a layer over a previous printed layer and repeating the task till the objective is completed. Just like 2D printers, 3D printers also come equipped with different techniques to achieve the same task. Each having it's own advantages. FDM method being the most widely used, achieves the printing task by melting a filament and tracing a pre determined path with the extruder and then rising the extruder and then tracing the next path over the previous one.\n\n## Agnikul\nBringing Space Within Everyone's Reach\nGoing to space shouldn’t be the hardest part of utilizing, living in or working from space.
