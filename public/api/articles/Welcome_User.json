Well I like to be lazy and don’t do any kind of work but I like to watch anime and have some snacks with also I love to read manga.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/Naruto.jpg\" alt=\"Naruto\"></p>\n<p>Many of you people may know what is manga and anime but for those who don’t know what is manga and anime I will explain you in simple way. Manga is a comic book which you can buy it from store and read it some may have colored pages some may not have have color pages. <del>Manga is spoiler for anime watchers</del></p>\n<p>If you have never read the manga or seen anime then I whole heartily recommend you to start with Naruto any of the manga or anime. You will find tons of site for the manga and to watch. Naruto is a part of my life as if he is alive in myself, I started watching Naruto from 2012 and ended all chapters the manga’s and all the episodes of anime too. Naruto taught to me many things in my life when I was in the starting years of me college, when my college started I use to see many couples in canteen siting hand in hand. I was really jealous of them but anime taught that being jealous is a part of your life you have to experience everything emotion of your life if you have happiness in your life that doesn’t mean that you won’t have happiness. I whole heartily thank all the anime and manga character to give me a new life.</p>\n","pinned":false,"text":"HelloHello, hope you’re doing well in this coronavirus. let’s get started from i...","link":"","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"1.4k","symbolsTime":"1 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"welcome","slug":"welcome","count":1,"path":"api/categories/welcome.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"welcome","slug":"welcome","count":1,"path":"api/tags/welcome.json"}],"toc":"<ol class=\"toc\"><li class=\"toc-item toc-level-2\"><a class=\"toc-link\" href=\"#Hello\"><span class=\"toc-text\">Hello</span></a></li></ol>","author":{"name":"Mr. Blogger","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"https://www.mistrysiddh.com/images/whoami/avatar.png","link":"https://www.mistrysiddh.com/","description":"","socials":{"github":"","twitter":"","stackoverflow":"","wechat":"","qq":"","weibo":"","zhihu":"","csdn":"","juejin":"","customs":{}}},"mapped":true,"hidden":false,"prev_post":{"title":"Changing Site","uid":"ebd32d5680bee3991482b662454a59b9","slug":"Transfer_Site","date":"2020-12-12T10:34:51.000Z","updated":"2023-08-22T08:17:35.371Z","comments":true,"path":"api/articles/Transfer_Site.json","keywords":null,"cover":"images/posts/transfer.png","text":"What is Wordpress?WordPress is a free and open-source content management system ...","link":"","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"6.1k","symbolsTime":"6 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"website","slug":"website","count":1,"path":"api/categories/website.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"new site","slug":"new-site","count":4,"path":"api/tags/new-site.json"}],"author":{"name":"Mr. Blogger","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"https://www.mistrysiddh.com/images/whoami/avatar.png","link":"https://www.mistrysiddh.com/","description":"","socials":{"github":"","twitter":"","stackoverflow":"","wechat":"","qq":"","weibo":"","zhihu":"","csdn":"","juejin":"","customs":{}}},"pinned":false},"next_post":{}}
