The development came days after the Hyderabad-based firm received the <code>Drugs Controller General of India’s (DCGI)</code> nod for its COVID-19 vaccine <code>Covaxin</code>. Covaxin, which is India’s first indigenously developed COVID-19 vaccine, has been given restricted (emergency use) approval for use along with <code>Serum Institute’s Covishield</code> developed by the <code>Oxford University</code> in collaboration with <code>AstraZeneca</code>.</p>\n<p>Earlier in September, <code>Bharat Biotech</code> announced that it has partnered with <code>Washington University School</code> of Medicine in <code>St Louis</code> for a novel <code>intranasal coronavirus vaccine (BBV154)</code>. The phase 1 human clinical trials of the nasal COVID-19 vaccine will be <code>conducted in India</code> and <code>Saint Louis University’s Vaccine</code> and <code>Treatment Evaluation Unit</code>. And here’s what we know so far about the company’s intranasal COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"BBV154-to-be-a-single-dose-regimen\"><a href=\"#BBV154-to-be-a-single-dose-regimen\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"BBV154 to be a single-dose regimen\"></a>BBV154 to be a single-dose regimen</h3><p>Bharat Biotech’s <code>BBV154</code> (a novel adenovirus vectored, intranasal vaccine for COVID-19) will be a <code>single-dose regimen</code>. According to the company, an intranasal vaccine stimulates broad immune responses at the site of infection (in the <code>nasal mucosa</code>), which is essential for blocking both infection and transmission of the <code>SARS-CoV-2 virus</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Non-invasive-needle-free\"><a href=\"#Non-invasive-needle-free\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Non-invasive, needle-free\"></a>Non-invasive, needle-free</h3><p>Another advantage of an intranasal vaccine is that it is simple to administer - the jab is administered to a person via the nose and does not require a needle or trained healthcare workers to give the vaccine. This also means eliminating needle-associated risks such as injuries and infections. The vaccine is also ideally suitable for children and adults.</p>\n<blockquote><span class=\"custom-blockquote-svg\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" data-reactroot=\"\">\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M22 12C22 6.5 17.5 2 12 2C6.5 2 2 6.5 2 12C2 17.5 6.5 22 12 22C13.8 22 15.5 21.5 17 20.6L22 22L20.7 17C21.5 15.5 22 13.8 22 12Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M17 8.5C15.23 8.97 14.07 10.84 14.01 13.27C14 13.33 14 13.4 14 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M9 8.5C7.23 8.97 6.07 10.84 6.01 13.27C6 13.33 6 13.4 6 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n</svg>\n</span><p>“An intranasal vaccine will not only be simple to administer but reduce the use of medical consumables such as needles, syringes, etc., significantly impacting the overall cost of a vaccination drive,” Dr Krishna Ella, Chairman and Managing Director of Bharat Biotech, had said.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><span class=\"custom-blockquote-svg\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" data-reactroot=\"\">\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M22 12C22 6.5 17.5 2 12 2C6.5 2 2 6.5 2 12C2 17.5 6.5 22 12 22C13.8 22 15.5 21.5 17 20.6L22 22L20.7 17C21.5 15.5 22 13.8 22 12Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M17 8.5C15.23 8.97 14.07 10.84 14.01 13.27C14 13.33 14 13.4 14 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M9 8.5C7.23 8.97 6.07 10.84 6.01 13.27C6 13.33 6 13.4 6 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n</svg>\n</span><p>“One drop of vaccine in each of the nostrils is sufficient,” he had said.</p></blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"Demonstrates-protective-efficacy\"><a href=\"#Demonstrates-protective-efficacy\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Demonstrates protective efficacy\"></a>Demonstrates protective efficacy</h3><p>The company said its intranasal vaccine candidate has demonstrated unprecedented levels of protection in mice studies - with the technology and data having been published in the <code>prestigious scientific journal Cell</code> and in an editorial in Nature.</p>\n<p>“Mice and hamsters immunized with a single dose of <code>ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S</code> conferred superior protection against <code>SARS-CoV-2</code> challenge, more so than one or two intramuscular immunizations of the same vaccine and dose.
