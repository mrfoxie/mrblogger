Webb, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, with respect to an invention oi Melvin N. Wilson, Jr., and Carl Thiele Filed Nov. 9, 1961, Ser. No. 180,384 12 Claims. (Cl. 73432) This invention relates to space simulators; that is, to apparatus adapted to simulate conditions approaching absolute zero temperature and pressure in the presence of a high level of solar radiation.</p>\n<p>Included in the objects of this invention are:</p>\n<p>First, to provide a space simulator in which ,a test chamber dimensioned to receive a model of a space vehicle is maintained under conditions of high vacuum and low temperature While the model is subjected to radiations approximating intensities and wave lengths of solar radiations.</p>\n<p>Second, to provide a space simulator which incorporates a novel optical system arranged to transmit radiations of appropriate wave length from a plurality of sources externally of the test chamber, through a wall of the test chamber in such a manner as to effect substantially uniform distribution throughout the test region.</p>\n<p>Third, to provide a space simulator which utilizes a parabolic main reflector substantially coextensive with one end of the test chamber, and a mating multiple cell reflector Within the test chamber, the multiple cell reflector being so related to the external optical system that the sum of the radiations from the radiation sources are distributed over the multiple cell reflector, and eachcell thereof reflects the radiations which it receives over essentially the entire surface of the main reflector so that the radiations received at any point on the main reflector are the sum of the reflections from all the cells of the multiple cell reflector; whereby the radiations transmitted by the main reflector tend to be uniform.</p>\n<p>‘Fourth, to provide a space simulator which is particularly adapted to produce radiations simulating the high intensity solar radiations believed to exist in the region of the planet Venus.</p>\n<p>The 1960s NASA sun simulator , nickname star was for an environment test chamber right here on earth to stimulate the sun found in space. with ongoing all the strange events in our space we could only imagine if they are stimulating certain environmental conditions of outer space, like an artificially created sun. The strange name star could refer to the Blue Star Kachina, harbinger of approaching Red Star Kachina also called the red planet ‘Nibiru’.<br>Is it possible to hide the Blue Star ‘Kachina’by placing optical illusion<br>An ancient prophecy states that the ,” When the Blue Star Kachina makes its appearance in heaven , the fifth world will emerge.” This would be the day of purification. Even though we cannot prove that NASA manipulates certain environmental conditions in outer space, like an artificially created sun, by using advanced technologies without doubt there is much more going on we cannot imagine.<a href=\"%5BHackerIdiot%5D(https://hackeridiot.wordpress.com/2018/08/06/nasa-patents-artificial-sun-in-the-1950s-to-be-used-as-nibiru/amp/)\">^Source</a></p>\n<blockquote><span class=\"custom-blockquote-svg\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" data-reactroot=\"\">\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M22 12C22 6.5 17.5 2 12 2C6.5 2 2 6.5 2 12C2 17.5 6.5 22 12 22C13.8 22 15.5 21.5 17 20.6L22 22L20.7 17C21.5 15.5 22 13.8 22 12Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M17 8.5C15.23 8.97 14.07 10.84 14.01 13.27C14 13.33 14 13.4 14 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M9 8.5C7.23 8.97 6.07 10.84 6.01 13.27C6 13.33 6 13.4 6 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n</svg>\n</span><p>Let us know what’s your thought in the comment section bellow and also if you have any suggestion then you can mail me to <a href=\"mailto:siddh.mistry396321@gmail.com\">siddh.mistry396321@gmail.com</a></p></blockquote>\n","pinned":false,"text":"KSTARCredit: National Research Council of Science &amp; Techonology Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) conducted a supe...","link":"","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"6.9k","symbolsTime":"6 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"Simulation","slug":"Simulation","count":1,"path":"api/categories/Simulation.json"},{"name":"Government","slug":"Simulation/Government","count":1,"path":"api/categories/Simulation/Government.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"technology","slug":"technology","count":13,"path":"api/tags/technology.json"},{"name":"record","slug":"record","count":1,"path":"api/tags/record.json"},{"name":"artificial","slug":"artificial","count":1,"path":"api/tags/artificial.json"}],"toc":"<ol class=\"toc\"><li class=\"toc-item toc-level-2\"><a class=\"toc-link\" href=\"#KSTAR\"><span class=\"toc-text\">KSTAR</span></a></li><li class=\"toc-item toc-level-2\"><a class=\"toc-link\" href=\"#Nasa-Patents-Artificial-Sun-in-1950%E2%80%99s\"><span class=\"toc-text\">Nasa Patents Artificial Sun in 1950’s</span></a><ol class=\"toc-child\"><li class=\"toc-item toc-level-3\"><a class=\"toc-link\" href=\"#Space-simulator\"><span class=\"toc-text\">Space-simulator</span></a></li><li class=\"toc-item toc-level-3\"><a class=\"toc-link\" href=\"#Description\"><span class=\"toc-text\">Description</span></a></li></ol></li></ol>","author":{"name":"Mr. Blogger","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"https://mistrysiddh.com/images/whoami/avatar.png","link":"/","description":"","socials":{"github":"","twitter":"","stackoverflow":"","wechat":"","qq":"","weibo":"","zhihu":"","csdn":"","juejin":"","customs":{}}},"mapped":true,"prev_post":{"title":"Are We Living in Simulation Part 03","uid":"158d689f0eef40852d529ddcb9af649b","slug":"Are-We-Living-In-Simulation-Part-03","date":"2021-01-03T01:00:55.000Z","updated":"2023-02-05T12:28:54.460Z","comments":true,"path":"api/articles/Are-We-Living-In-Simulation-Part-03.json","keywords":null,"cover":"/images/posts/They-Lived-1988.jpg","text":"I suggest you kindly read both the part so that you can understand on which topic we are discussing on Part One &amp; Part Second.
