Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-is-an-AI\"><a href=\"#What-is-an-AI\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What is an AI?\"></a>What is an AI?</h2><p>Artificial intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of ‚Äúintelligent agents‚Äù any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Automation</strong>, <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>Supercomputer</strong>, <strong>Quantum computers</strong> are currently leading technology in the world right now as you know many top leading companies in the industry are using <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>Automation</strong>, and many leading technology which help them to make there service‚Äôs better and easier to control. In <strong>video games</strong>, <strong>AI</strong> is used to generate <strong>responsive</strong>, <strong>adaptive</strong> or <strong>intelligent behaviors</strong> primarily in <strong>non-player characters (NPCs)</strong> similar to <strong>human-like intelligence</strong>. <strong>AI</strong> has been an integral part of video games since there inception in <strong>1950s</strong>.[^1]</p>\n<p><strong>Google</strong> also recently revealed it is using <strong>AI</strong> and <strong>machine learning techniques</strong> to more quickly <strong>detect breaking news</strong> around <strong>natural disasters</strong> and other <strong>crises</strong>. In a <strong>related development</strong>, <strong>Google</strong> said it has launched an update using language models to improve matching between news stories and available fact-checking.[^2]</p>\n<p>The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> for <strong>Android</strong> devices will be able to affect the user‚Äôs everyday life. For example, right now an <strong>AI</strong> app for <strong>Android</strong> can calculate the distance you walked on any given day as well as how many steps you have taken, how many flights of stairs you climbed and many other physical activity data.[^3]</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-truth-behind-Facebook-AI-inventing-a-new-language\"><a href=\"#The-truth-behind-Facebook-AI-inventing-a-new-language\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The truth behind Facebook AI inventing a new language\"></a>The truth behind Facebook AI inventing a new language</h3><p>In back 2017 one of the most talking question about <code>Why did Facebook shut down its own AI after its Bot invented its own language?</code> most of online articles mislead the topic at that time, but the original question was <code>Was Facebook right to shut down it&#39;s AI after it invented its own language?</code>[^4]</p>\n<blockquote><span class=\"custom-blockquote-svg\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" data-reactroot=\"\">\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M22 12C22 6.5 17.5 2 12 2C6.5 2 2 6.5 2 12C2 17.5 6.5 22 12 22C13.8 22 15.5 21.5 17 20.6L22 22L20.7 17C21.5 15.5 22 13.8 22 12Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path fill=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\" undefined=\"1\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M17 8.5C15.23 8.97 14.07 10.84 14.01 13.27C14 13.33 14 13.4 14 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M9 8.5C7.23 8.97 6.07 10.84 6.01 13.27C6 13.33 6 13.4 6 13.47V13.5\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M15.97 11.5H16.04C17.12 11.5 18 12.38 18 13.47V13.53C18 14.62 17.12 15.5 16.03 15.5H15.96C14.88 15.5 14 14.62 14 13.53V13.46C14 12.38 14.88 11.5 15.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n<path stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"\" d=\"M7.97 11.5H8.04C9.12 11.5 10 12.38 10 13.47V13.53C10 14.62 9.12 15.5 8.03 15.5H7.97C6.88 15.5 6 14.62 6 13.53V13.46C6 12.38 6.88 11.5 7.97 11.5Z\"></path>\n</svg>\n</span><p>Bob: i can i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>Alice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to</p>\n<p>Bob: you i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>Alice: balls have a ball to me to me to me to me to me to me to me</p>\n<p>Bob: i i can i i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>Alice: balls have a ball to me to me to me to me to me to me to me</p>\n<p>Bob: i . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>Alice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to</p>\n<p>Bob: you i i i i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>Alice: balls have 0 to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to</p>\n<p>Bob: you i i i everything else . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>Alice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to</p></blockquote>\n<p>As above you can see the chat between <code>Bob</code> and <code>Alice</code> I‚Äôm not a cyber expert or some kind of decipher expert I leave it up-to you üòÖ.
