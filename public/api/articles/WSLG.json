The main purpose of using this is so that you can easily use both the windows and Linux apps together on single operating system, after you have installed this WSLG on your system it will look like this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/posts/WSLg_IntegratedDesktop.png\" alt=\"WSLG\"></p>\n<p>Let’s start the installation process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Brief-Introduction\"><a href=\"#Brief-Introduction\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Brief Introduction\"></a>Brief Introduction</h2><p>WSLg is short for <em>Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI</em> and the purpose of the project is to enable support for running Linux GUI applications (X11 and Wayland) on Windows in a fully integrated desktop experience.</p>\n<p>WSLg provides an integrated experience for developers, scientists or enthusiasts that prefer or need to run Windows on their PC but also need the ability to run tools or applications which works best, or exclusively, in a Linux environment. While users can accomplish this today using a multiple system setup, with individual PC dedicated to Windows and Linux, virtual machine hosting either Windows or Linux, or an XServer running on Windows and projected into WSL, WSLg provides a more integrated, user friendly and productive alternative.</p>\n<p>WSLg strives to make Linux GUI applications feel native and natural to use on Windows. From integration into the Start Menu for launch to appearing in the task bar, alt-tab experience to enabling cut/paste across Windows and Linux applications, WSLg enables a seamless desktop experience and workflow leveraging Windows and Linux applications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Installation\"><a href=\"#Installation\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Installation\"></a>Installation</h2><h3 id=\"Pre-requirements\"><a href=\"#Pre-requirements\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Pre-requirements\"></a>Pre-requirements</h3><p>Before you begin installation of WSLG you have to check few thing on your system so that there is no error while installation. Here are the requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><input checked=\"\" disabled=\"\" type=\"checkbox\"> <code>Windows 10 Insider Preview build 21362+</code> (required for now but in future it will be available for normal builds if you aren’t on this build then go to setup <a href=\"https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/wsl2install/#installation-of-wsl-2\">Windows Insider</a> and get latest versions of Insider Preview build)</li>\n<li><input checked=\"\" disabled=\"\" type=\"checkbox\"> Choose your GPU (if you have already install drivers then you can skip this steps)<ul>\n<li><input checked=\"\" disabled=\"\" type=\"checkbox\"> <a href=\"https://community.amd.com/community/radeon-pro-graphics/blog/2020/06/17/announcing-amd-support-for-gpu-accelerated-machine-learning-training-on-windows-10\">AMD GPU driver for WSL</a></li>\n<li><input checked=\"\" disabled=\"\" type=\"checkbox\"> <a href=\"https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/29526\">Intel GPU driver for WSL</a></li>\n<li><input checked=\"\" disabled=\"\" type=\"checkbox\"> <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl\">NVIDIA GPU driver for WSL</a> (I have NVIDIA GeForce on my device so I have already installed it)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Install-instructions\"><a href=\"#Install-instructions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Install instructions\"></a>Install instructions</h3><p>I assume that you have installed WSL on your system but if you haven’t installed it yet then go to <a href=\"https://www.mistrysiddh.tk/posts/ws2install/\">WSL2 Installation</a> and install it. Moving further If you have an existing WSL installation without WSLg and want to update to the latest version of WSL which includes WSLg, run the command <code>wsl --update</code> from an elevated command prompt, and also download and install <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/releases/tag/v1.0.24\">Linux GUI support</a> on your system so that the software requirement to run WSLg will be installed automatically. </p>\n<p>Please note that WSLg is only compatible with WSL 2 and will not work for WSL distribution configured to work in WSL 1 mode. Verify that your Linux distro is configured for running in WSL 2 mode, if not switch to WSL 2. While you can continue to run Linux distro in WSL 1 mode after installing WSLg if you so desired, a distro configured to run in WSL 1 mode will not be able to communicate with WSLg and will not be able to run GUI applications.</p>\n<p>You can list your currently installed distro and the version of WSL they are configured for using the following command from an elevated command prompt.</p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers language-powershell\" data-language=\"powershell\"><code class=\"language-powershell\">wsl <span class=\"token operator\">--</span>list <span class=\"token operator\">-</span>v<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\"><span></span></span></code></pre>\n\n<p>If running in version 1 mode, switch to version 2. This can take a while.</p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers language-powershell\" data-language=\"powershell\"><code class=\"language-powershell\">wsl <span class=\"token operator\">--</span><span class=\"token function\">set-version</span> _distro_name_ 2<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\"><span></span></span></code></pre>\n\n<p>Restart WSL by running this command from an elevated command prompt, make sure to save any pending work first:</p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers language-powershell\" data-language=\"powershell\"><code class=\"language-powershell\">wsl <span class=\"token operator\">--</span>shutdown<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\"><span></span></span></code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"Updating-WSL-WSLg\"><a href=\"#Updating-WSL-WSLg\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Updating WSL + WSLg\"></a>Updating WSL + WSLg</h2><p>To update to the latest version of WSL and WSLg released for preview, simply run <code>wsl --update</code> from an elevated command prompt or powershell.</p>\n<p>You’ll need to restart WSL for the changes to take effect. You can restart WSL by running <code>wsl --shutdown</code> from an elevated command prompt. If WSL was currently running, it will shutdown, make sure to first save any in progress work! WSL will be automatically restarted the next time you launch a WSL application or terminal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"First-Launch\"><a href=\"#First-Launch\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"First Launch\"></a>First Launch</h2><p>If you have installed the <code>Ubuntu</code> Linux distro per these instructions, you’ll find an <code>Ubuntu</code> icon in your start menu, launch it. This will launch the WSL 2 VM, launch the Ubuntu WSL distro in that VM and give you a terminal to interact with it. Voila! You’re running Linux on Windows!</p>\n<p>If you would like to explore additional Linux distributions built for WSL, you can use the <code>wsl --list --online</code> command from an elevated command prompt to enumerate the list of available distributions for your system. You can have multiple Linux distributions installed within WSL and they will happily coexist side-by-side, so don’t be scared to experiment and try things out. Now let’s install and try some apps</p>\n<h2 id=\"Install-and-run-GUI-apps\"><a href=\"#Install-and-run-GUI-apps\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Install and run GUI apps\"></a>Install and run GUI apps</h2><p>If you want to get started with some GUI apps, you can run the following commands from your Linux terminal to download and install some popular applications. If you are using a different distribution than Ubuntu, it may be using a different package manager.</p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers language-none\"><code class=\"language-none\">## Update all packages in your distro\nsudo apt update\n\n## Gedit\nsudo apt install gedit -y\n\n## GIMP\nsudo apt install gimp -y\n\n## Nautilus\nsudo apt install nautilus -y\n\n## VLC\nsudo apt install vlc -y\n\n## X11 apps\nsudo apt install x11-apps -y\n\n## Google Chrome\ncd &#x2F;tmp\nsudo wget https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.google.com&#x2F;linux&#x2F;direct&#x2F;google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb \nsudo apt install --fix-broken -y\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\n\n## Microsoft Teams\ncd &#x2F;tmp\nsudo curl -L -o &quot;.&#x2F;teams.deb&quot; &quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teams.microsoft.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;desktopurl?env&#x3D;production&amp;plat&#x3D;linux&amp;arch&#x3D;x64&amp;download&#x3D;true&amp;linuxArchiveType&#x3D;deb&quot;\nsudo apt install .&#x2F;teams.deb -y\n\n## Microsoft Edge Browser\nsudo curl https:&#x2F;&#x2F;packages.microsoft.com&#x2F;repos&#x2F;edge&#x2F;pool&#x2F;main&#x2F;m&#x2F;microsoft-edge-dev&#x2F;microsoft-edge-dev_91.0.852.0-1_amd64.deb -o &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;edge.deb\nsudo apt install &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;edge.deb -y<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>\n\n<p>Once these applications are installed, you’ll find them in your start menu under the distro name. For example <code>Ubuntu -&gt; Microsoft Edge</code>. You can also launch these from your terminal window using the commands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>xcalc</code>, <code>xclock</code>, <code>xeyes</code></li>\n<li><code>gimp</code></li>\n<li><code>gedit ~/.bashrc</code></li>\n<li><code>nautilus</code></li>\n<li><code>vlc</code></li>\n<li><code>google-chrome</code></li>\n<li><code>teams</code></li>\n<li><code>microsoft-edge</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Congrats you are done and ready to use GUI apps!</strong> </p>\n","feature":true,"text":"RecapsIn previous post we have seen how to install Windows Subsystem Linux in your windows 10, so in this we will see
