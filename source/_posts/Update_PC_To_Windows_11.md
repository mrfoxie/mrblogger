## Windows Insider Registration
The path for upgrading to 11 requires you to have an activated Windows 10 PC and be subscribed to the insider builds.

Insider builds can be registerd for use  [https://insider.windows.com/](https://insider.windows.com/)

## System Modification

Windows 11 does checks for TPM and Secure boot before it allows the upgrade process to start. However, these can be bypassed.

Note: It is important to understand Microsoft can at ANY TIME enforce these rules or ignore these modifications which means you would NO LONGER recieve updates

Here is the registry edits that need to be made: (win11bypass.reg)

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\LabConfig]
"BypassTPMCheck"=dword:00000001
"BypassSecureBootCheck"=dword:00000001
```
